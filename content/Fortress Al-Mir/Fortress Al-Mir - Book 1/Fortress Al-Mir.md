## 01 - The Hunt


Arkk drew back his bowstring, taking careful aim. He didn’t blink, he barely breathed. Even when the draw of the bow weighed on his arm, he simply clenched his teeth and stared across the field. Arkk watched and waited for the most opportune moment, intending to use every aspect of the situation to his advantage.

The beast dipped its head, antlers disturbing leaves as it sniffed at a crop of berries. Animals were most skittish when eating, but they were also still.

As soon as he saw the stag bite at the bush, Arkk released the string, loosing the arrow.

Whether it was the twang of the bowstring, the rustle of the arrow as it flew through some loose brush, or some unconscious grunt Arkk made, the stag started. It didn’t look up and stare, it *bolted* without hesitation. The arrow still struck, but in its rear, not in the heart or skull. It wasn’t a fatal blow. The stag wouldn’t even bleed out in all likelihood.

“Damn.”

“Ah well, shame.”

Arkk’s gaze slid to the side where Ilya shoved off from a tree. The elf had remained so still for so long that he had *almost* forgotten about her presence. “Shame?” he said, not bothering with remaining quiet. That stag rushing off would have frightened away all the other game in the immediate area. “That stag was big enough to feed the village for a week. Bit more than a *shame*.”

“Don’t let it get you down. It was a good shot. You just had a spot of bad luck.”

“No such thing as luck,” Arkk said, slinging Ilya’s bow over his shoulder as he moved forward. His eyes roamed over the area as he tried to figure out a way to salvage the situation. “Just opportunities and what you do with them.”

“So,” Ilya said, putting on a grin, “you’re saying you missed because of your own incompetence?”

Arkk’s eyes shifted, glaring. “Maybe a *little* luck,” he admitted under his breath.

“Come on. We’re not going to get anything else in the area today. Let’s head back to camp.”

“That’s half a day’s hike in the wrong direction,” Arkk said, feeling bad for the poor stag. If they didn’t hunt it down, he’ll have just skewered its hindquarters for no good reason. “We can still track it down.”

“The camp—and our cart—is a half-day away already. You want to go after it and then try to lug it back? We’ll never make it.” Ilya shook her head, sending her gleaming silver hair shaking around her shoulders. “In case you missed it, that thing was huge. It was already going to take forever, but now? Even if we found it *and* killed it, we’ll return the triumphant hunters! Our spoils, spoiled meat.”

Arkk crossed his arms, shooting the elf another glare. “If you go get the cart now, that would help.”

“Through these trees? And back? I doubt it would be much faster.”

His eyes drifted off to the east. They were close enough to the Cursed Forest to see the way the plants didn’t quite grow as thick as they did elsewhere. They hadn’t gone through the forest to get here, of course. It was a three-day trip back to the village by going *around* the Cursed Forest but through it? It was a half day’s trek through the dead brush, dead trees, and relatively flat land to reach Langleey Village.

In looking back toward Ilya, Arkk caught a glint of something glistening on the berry bush. Smile spreading across his face, he gripped his bow and started forward.

“Where are you going?”

“You should get the cart,” Arkk said as he moved across a small clearing to the berry bush. Once there, he plucked the glistening leaf. “We’ll take the carcass back *tonight*.”

Blood glinted on the leaf, catching the sunlight. Quite a bit of blood, actually, once he looked around the area where the stag had bolted off. Beyond the initial bloodied ground, the trail petered off, becoming much harder to see as the stag picked up its speed. Still, Arkk doubted it was enough for the stag to bleed out. But it might be injured, tired, and resting to lick its wounds. Ineffectual though his arrow had been at killing the beast, with a bit of it in his hands, he *should* be able to find it.

Kneeling down, Arkk picked up a stick and started dragging symbols into the ground. A circle to contain the magic, a triangle for the source material, radiating lines to seek out more of the material, and several squiggly lines that *resembled* runes but *probably* didn’t matter. And—

“Oh no. You’re going to make it explode?”

“It’s a tracking spell. That mercenary group that passed through the village last year had a spellcaster with a beginner spell book. He let me look through it while they were staying over at the church.”

Ilya frowned, considering. “You’re trying to remember something you saw in a book one time over a year ago?”

“It was a very simple spell. I have part of the stag here, so I can use it to find the rest of the stag.”

“What does that symbol mean?” she asked, pointing with her brown leather boot.

Arkk hesitated, looking at the scrawled lines he had scraped into the dirt. The specific marking that Ilya was pointing out was… a marking for joining? Or… maybe it was just a smudge in the dirt that had already been there.

Ilya let out an exasperated sigh, his hesitation having gone on far too long. “You’re going to make that poor thing explode.”

Arkk didn’t dignify her comment with a response. Sure, one or two spells he had tried out in the past hadn’t turned out as he expected them to. This was a simple spell; it came from a beginner book. He might not be able to remember exactly what each line did, but that spellcaster had said that *intent* mattered most.

He intended to find that stag.

Standing so that the triangle with the leaf pointed at him, Arkk took a deep breath. He had to be careful. That spellcaster said that he had great magic potential. Too great, even. That was why everything failed, he poured too much magic into everything he tried. Had he been born in one of the cities, the Abbey of the Light would have sent him off to an academy to teach him *proper* sorcery. Instead, he had been born in Langleey. With no guidance, he often ended up causing problems with *knowing* he could do more but just not knowing *how*.

The moment he started to feel a tingle, Arkk snapped his eyes open, cutting off the magic he was pouring into the circle.

His eyes were first drawn to the berry bush. It glowed with a faint ethereal silhouette. Like a ghost in the shape of the plant had settled down just over the top of it. Except, he could see the entire ghost despite Ilya standing in the way. The effect hurt his head a bit, but he shook it off, turning his head toward the direction of the stag.

The trail of blood stood out to him in much the same way. Little pale white splotches that he could see *through* the surrounding trees and brush. Looking further into the distance, he could see a much larger mass in the shape of the stag. It looked like a ghost wandering through the forest.

“Oh. That looks good,” he said, following the movements of the distant stag.

“You did something that worked?”

“Well, I didn’t mean to see where the bush was.” Arkk glanced down at the leaf in the triangle. “I suppose that makes sense though.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“It’s easy to prove,” Arkk said, hurrying through the forest. “I don’t think it is too far. It looks like it stopped sprinting, anyway. Let’s hurry. I don’t know how long this will last.”

Ilya’s long legs made it easy for her to keep up despite his rush. “Try not to spook it again. I don’t want to be chasing this thing all week.”

“You’re not getting the cart?”

“I’m not going to track you through the trees while on a cart *without* knowing that you actually managed to get the stag. Hunt it and I’ll figure out the best path to take the cart on my way back to it.”

“That’s going to take a lot of time…”

“I can move quickly on my own. I’ve got long legs.”

“That you do, Ilya,” Arkk said, glancing aside to admire his hunting companion. “Say, maybe those long legs—”

“Are too long for you,” the elf said, tone annoyed but without any real heat behind her words. “You should focus on your target, you lovesick fool.”

Arkk let out a small chuckle but followed her advice.

The stag was still upwind of them. They would have to slow down and try to avoid making noise once they got closer, but for now, Arkk kept up a hasty rush through the brush. He hopped felled branches, skipped over a narrow brook, and found a worn deer trail that let him run in roughly the correct direction without having to worry about further debris.

Arkk skidded to a stop as they closed the distance on the stag. The ethereal glow started to fade and, in a moment of panic, Arkk poured more magic into the spell.

The glow came back, but…

“What’s wrong?”

“Uh,” Arkk said. “I, uh…”

Ilya’s brilliant silver eyes flashed in irritation, though her lips quirked into a mirthful smile. “You made it explode, didn’t you.”

“No! I didn’t even…” Arkk shot her a glare. “Maybe… a little bit.”

“Oh, just a little explosion,” Ilya said, nodding her head. “Of course. I’m sure it’s fine then.”

“Don’t get your hopes up,” Arkk grumbled, staring at the ethereal… mess. It was still shuddering on the ground, twitching and… looking like it was being ripped apart. Forcing his stomach to be calm, Arkk tried to look at the positives of the situation. If it *was* exploded, some of it should still be salvageable. They would have some meat to take back to the village. “Come on, we’ll find out soon enough. It isn’t far now.”

Though not far, it still took quite some time to reach the stag. A little under an hour, by his estimate. Throughout it all, Arkk had to watch as the stag continued to peel apart. Rather than a side effect of whatever he had done, it looked like some wild animals were ripping it apart.

Eventually, he spotted the stag on the ground, half hidden behind a large tree. It wasn’t moving. It wasn’t breathing, as far as he could see.

A spray of viscera coated most of the surrounding trees. A few bits of skin hung off branches and an antler was sticking out of a rock a short distance away. But there was something more as well. Something that made Arkk ready an arrow.

Circling slowly, bow at the ready, Arkk’s eyes widened as he watched the translucent silhouette spread out beyond the beast’s body. Further than the explosion looked to have gone. Looking at the beast itself, Arkk frowned. Claw and teeth marks covered the soft underside of the stag’s carcass. Large chunks had been ripped from it. Consumed? His eyes looked around, searching for more of the creature. Small ghostly flecks of blood trailed off a short distance around the forest, but no large chunks that might have been resting in something’s belly. Perhaps because it now counted as part of something else, rather than the stag?

Before he could consider more on the mysteries of the magic he was using, Ilya let out a loud hissing noise. “Goblins,” she said, drawing her short sword. Her silver eyes darted around the forest, looking for any sign of a threat.

Arkk’s wide eyes went back to the stag, looking over its wounds again. He had thought some wild animal got to the exploded stag, but investigating closer, he couldn’t deny the ripping and tearing looked too systematic to be a random animal. Stepping back from the corpse, he scanned the ground, quickly finding three-toed footprints stamped into the dirt around its body.

“They went that way,” he said, pointing toward the fading trail of ghostly blood left behind by the messy eaters. The footprints headed in the same direction, confirming what he saw through his magic.

Staring at the footprints made Arkk gasp. One of them was not like the rest. Rather than the three-toed bare footprints of the goblins, this one was much larger and covered, as if the maker had worn proper footwear. A bit larger than Arkk’s foot. It couldn’t be his footprint. Nor would it be Ilya’s. Neither had walked beyond the carcass.

“An orc?” he asked, waving Ilya over. “I can’t think of anything else that would willingly travel with goblins like that.”

“A pack of goblins is bad enough. Organized goblins?” Ilya said, walking around, staring at the ground. “More orc footprints over here. Different ones for sure. Three… four… five of them? Light, this is bad. Why are they *here*?”

“The goblins probably smelled the blood and the orcs lost control of them.”

“Why are they here in general?” Ilya asked. “Not this specific spot.”

“They… they couldn’t be after the village, right?”

Pressing her lips together, Ilya nodded her head. “Maybe. Maybe not. We have to warn them.”

“It’s a three-day trek back after going back to camp for the horses.”

“Not if we skirt the edge of the Cursed Forest.”

Arkk looked in the direction of the blood trail, wishing the goblins or orcs had left a part of themselves behind so he could try tracking them. “I think *they* are skirting the edge of the Cursed Forest. We can’t take on a whole horde on our own,” he said, then slowly looked eastward. “But if we cut through the forest–”

“No! No.” Ilya took a deep breath, gnawing on her lip as she looked around the bloodied carcass. “I can move swiftly on my own. And stealthily.” She looked to the sun, low in the western sky. “It is almost night. If they stop for camp and I slip past them, I can reach the village by morning.”

“What if they don’t camp? What if they *find you*?”

Ilya offered a wan smile. “That’s why you’re heading back to camp. Grab the horses, leave the cart. Ride as fast as you can.”

“That’s too long,” Arkk said, shaking his head. “It will take half the night traveling in the wrong direction just to get back to camp.”

“If I get caught, I’ll lead them around by their nose, buying you as much time as I can. If I don’t get caught, then I’ll make it before you.” Her sharp, blade-like ears twitched as she forced a smile. “You can do this. But we’re wasting time. Go!”

Without waiting for a response, she turned and rushed off through the brush and trees, hurrying in the direction the footprints had gone.

Grinding his teeth, Arkk turned away from the carcass. He started toward the sunset, only to pause. There was no chance he would ever make it to the village before Ilya or the monsters. At best, he would show up in time to help defend the village. At worst, he would find it ransacked.

Putting the sun to his back, he stared beyond the green trees and lively section of the forest. The Cursed Forest was by far the shortest path. With as much traveling as they had done chasing after that stag, he was even closer now. If he didn’t stop for the night, he could make it to the village well before sunrise.

The sooner he got to the village, the sooner they could prepare and rally for a defense.

Time was of the essence.

Sun at his back, he took off in a sprint.

## 02 - The Cursed Forest


The Cursed Forest wasn’t so much a forest as it was a desolate wasteland. The surrounding *proper* forest went by the name of Langleey Forest, even though it was further away from Langleey than a few other burgs and villages. Like normal forests, it contained all the usual foresty things. Trees, grass, brush, rolling hills, rocks, and plenty of animals and insects and other fauna. But at a certain point in Arkk’s trek, with the sun at his back, the forest thinned out. Thick, healthy trees turned scrawny and leafless. Plants thinned and yellowed. Even the dirt itself went from a healthy brown to a dead gray color, filled with small cracks and larger fissures.

The people of Langleey Village did not venture inside. When visiting Langleey Forest for food or timber, people took a long and roundabout trail to get to the part of the forest where Ilya and Arkk had been hunting. Legends said that those who ventured in would emerge with a taint that poisoned the ground around them with every step.

That wasn’t true. Arkk had been inside before with Ilya when they were children. He didn’t know what caused the Cursed Forest to become the way it was, but he knew that it wasn’t contagious. That was likely a story meant to keep adventurous children from doing just what he and Ilya had done. That said, it wasn’t without its dangers. Loose soil and deep crevasses presented natural hazards. There were always rumors of monsters, even if he had never seen any evidence.

He had to be careful.

Leaping over a wide fissure in the wasteland, Arkk landed mid-stride. He slowed for nothing, not even the largest of the cracks in the ground. While the sun was still up, he wanted to get as far as he could. Once the sun set, he would only have moonlight to guide his way. There wasn’t a cloud in sight and the moon had been bright these last few nights, but he would still have to slow down then.

Arkk considered himself more athletic than most in his village. They were strong, and work had a way of hardening bodies, but the kindest word he could use to describe most of them would be *stout*. Growing up alongside Ilya gave him far more time running and moving than he wanted. Even still, his heart hammered in his chest and his lungs wanted ten times the air he could give them. Sweat rolled down his face, back, and arms. The constant leaps and hops over flat but unstable terrain were taking its toll on his legs. He had discarded his sword and Ilya’s bow and arrows to move faster, keeping a small dagger for defense. No bow was going to save him if he stumbled into a horde. If he made it to his village, he could reequip for the defense.

Though Ilya might kill him when she learned he left her bow behind. He was pretty sure he could find it again if they retraced their steps, however. At the moment, he didn’t care. He needed to get back.

In a way, he was glad he was in such a rush. Moving with purpose, even a worried purpose, felt good.

With the sun at his back, low in the sky, the shadows ahead of him stretched clear to the horizon. Dodging around a boulder, he walked along its shadow for two dozen paces. A rickety dead tree cast a shadow ten times as long. They were like spikes. Or teeth of some vast monster—though only the lower teeth. If he went slower, he would have had time to process the eerie atmosphere.

Instead, he planted his hands on a fallen tree, vaulting off into a long shadow.

A divot in the shadow snared his foot.

Arkk swung his arms forward, catching himself just before his face met the dirt. He still skidded along the ground for a short distance, slamming his hip and one shoulder into the coarse ground. Sucking in a sharp breath, pain spiking along his side and forearm, he sat in the dirt for a few moments just feeling his own body.

Was he injured? Nothing felt broken. Grateful for the leather gloves saving his hands from being ground to raw meat, he clenched his teeth and focused. His hip stung the most. Pulling up his tunic, he hissed at the long scrapes. From his stomach down to his thigh, blood seeped from thin lines of torn skin. Scrapes that would soon bruise. Nothing more. It would hurt, but he could still run.

There was no time to dress the wound. He *had* to get to the village. They needed warning. If Ilya failed and a group of orcs and goblins attacked…

He didn’t want to think about what might happen.

Clenching his teeth, Arkk mustered as much willpower as he could to push himself back to his feet. As much as he wanted to rest, if he took even a short break, he would likely find himself too worn to continue.

On his feet, he locked his eyes on the horizon with clenched teeth. One foot in front of the other. Faster and faster, until he was back to his previous speed. He kicked off with his boot, launching into a sprint once again.

He ran, planting one foot on the ground and then the other… until his foot found nothing underneath.

Eyes widening as his stomach flipped, Arkk fell into a fissure shadowed by a small boulder. His back hit the dirt wall after a short distance, grinding down a steep slope. His hands and boots found no purchase to slow him down. He slid a long way until the earthen wall vanished from beneath him. After falling a short distance through open air, Arkk landed with a grunt on something squishy.

Arkk sat still for a long moment. With his hip burning and now his back feeling like he had been raked over hot coals, he needed a bit longer than before. Foolish. After the first fall, he should have been more careful. He had wanted to get as far as he could in the last vestiges of the light, but now he wasn’t moving anywhere at all.

Groaning, Arkk tried to look around but saw nothing. The fissure overhead looked like a jagged crack in the night sky. No light was getting down, however. If the sun had been higher in the sky… He was in some kind of cavern, that much he could tell by the feeling of the air around him. Underneath him… it almost felt like a bed. A bed of somewhat slimy texture, moving like an oversized waterskin pouch.

Something moved beneath him. Whatever he landed on shuddered and began descending. The squishy bed pulled out from beneath him.

That got Arkk to jolt despite his pain.

Nothing lived in the Cursed Forest. *Nothing* except rumors. And yet something was moving?

Arkk rolled to the side, away from the direction of movement. He ended up on much firmer ground, though still soft. At least this felt more like woven mats than a water-filled sack. *Unmoving* woven mats. That, he felt, was the key part.

Feeling at his side, his fingers curled around the hilt of his dagger. Glad it hadn’t gotten knocked loose, he slammed it into the woven mat and traced out a small symbol to the best of his ability. It felt like hard stone beneath, but he was far less concerned about his blade’s edge than he was about being able to see.

Symbol complete, Arkk poured the tiniest amount of magic into it, not wanting to have it blow up in his face.

A brilliant yellow flame erupted from the ground instead. Arkk threw himself backward at the unexpected fire, only to realize that it wasn’t spreading. Small mercies. If he remembered the pattern right, a small orb of light should have popped up into the air. As it was, he supposed the column of flame was doing its job of providing light. Not much, but enough to see the rest of the area by.

He had been wrong. This was no cavern. A cavern was a natural structure. Brick walls and a vaulted ceiling didn’t form naturally. Nor did caves form… beds? It looked like the room was filled with rows and rows of beds—not whatever he landed on as these looked like something he might have in his home. None were occupied, thankfully. In fact, with the amount of dust and dirt coating every inch of them, he doubted anyone had touched them in decades upon decades.

There was, he noted, no sign of whatever he landed on. The area beneath the fissure was just empty ground, covered with some kind of woven mat or carpet. The lack of anything soft sent a chill down his spine. What *had* he landed on?

Shuddering, he looked up at the fissure. The slope didn’t look as steep as he thought it was. If not for his momentum, he might not have slid all the way down. As it was, he could probably climb back out. If he could reach the fissure.

It might be possible to stack up the beds and climb up them, but… that could take all night. And that assumed that there were enough beds to reach the top of the vaulted ceiling. It was quite high up.

Arkk’s eyes lowered to a doorway at the far end of the room. A door implied that there was more to this place. Beds indicated that people lived down here at one point in time. If people had to get in, they could get back out. That meant there should be an alternate way up.

He was losing time.

With a faint limp, he hurried over to the closest wall. There were torches mounted along the walls, many of which still looked oily at the end. Assuming it would work, he pulled one off the wall and swept it through the flames he had made. Sure enough, it roared to life, providing much greater illumination in the dark. Sweeping a foot through his magic circle snuffed the fire he had started.

Pushing open the door took a great deal more effort than he imagined it was supposed to take. It felt more like he was breaking the hinges on the door than operating them. Even still, he pushed open the door and stepped into a long, narrow corridor.

The corridor had collapsed at one end, leaving him only one direction to walk. There were a few more doors in the other direction, but what drew his eye were the bodies.

“I think I found the owners of those beds,” Arkk mumbled to himself.

On both sides of the corridor, periodically slumped against the walls, were at least a dozen corpses. Some might have been wearing armor. For others… it was hard to tell. Perhaps they had simply worn less robust armor, a material that had disintegrated over time. And it had been a great time since whatever happened here. None of the bodies were anything more than bones.

A rush of wind that sounded like whispers at his back caused the torch to flicker. He whirled, breathing heavily with his dagger gripped in his other hand.

The corridor was empty save for the collapsed tunnel and more bones.

“Is someone there?” Arkk called out. Drawing attention to himself might be a poor decision under most circumstances. He was already wandering around with a torch, kicking open doors. The advantage of getting help tipped the scales against alerting something that was going to notice him anyway.

Wondering if he had let in a draft by opening the door, he simply turned back and continued on the only path he could.

He pushed open each door as he passed them, checking what was inside. The first room, closest to the barracks, looked like a king’s armory. Weapons and equipment hung from the walls, though most spots were empty. The gear equipped on all the bodies littering the place went in those slots. Everything looked so old that if he picked them up, they would probably turn to dust. One room looked like it had chicken coops and pig pens along with a small field. That one, in particular, had him pausing. The field actually had plants growing. Considering how dead everything else was in the Cursed Forest, even a small bit of life surprised him.

Passing by training rooms and even a pool, perhaps for bathing or recreation—though Arkk wasn’t sure if that had been the original purpose of the room or if rainwater had simply accumulated in a basin meant for other purposes—he deduced that this place had been some kind of self-sufficient fortress. Despite living not far away, he had never heard even the faintest rumors of such a place. That, combined with the completely decomposed bodies, meant it was probably so ancient that *nobody* knew about it.

He wanted to explore the place more than merely glancing into each room. He wanted to drag Ilya here and explore it with her. But to do that, he had to get out of here and save the village.

The one thing he had yet to find were stairs.

Coming to a third intersection in the corridor, Arkk started feeling despair settling in. Just how large was this place? The rooms were massive. Half his village could fit within the sleeping quarters and he had found *three* such rooms so far. The other two intersections had been a full crossroads, allowing him to simply continue stumbling his way forward. This one, however, only had two choices. He could go left or right.

Picking at random, Arkk selected the right path.

The second he took a step, he felt it again. That rush of whispering wind at his back. He whirled around, eyes searching.

In the dark corners of the corridor where the light from his torch failed to reach, he did see something. It looked like the shadows themselves were twisting and writhing. The strangest thing was inside the umbra. Little golden orbs, like miniature suns that failed to provide light. If they had remained where they were, he might have thought they were some ancient magical lighting technique that had since failed. But they didn’t.

The little golden stars winked out of existence, one by one, as the shadows stilled and returned to normal.

It only took a moment. If he hadn’t turned around so quickly, he would have missed it entirely. Now, however, he couldn’t help but feel that something was watching him. Magic or monster, *something* had made this empty fortress its home. Was it upset at his presence? Or merely curious? It hadn’t attacked him so far, which he was taking as a good sign.

Was this thing in the shadows what he had landed upon? Unless there was something else moving down here…

Abandoning his chosen path, Arkk followed after those shadowy lights. It hadn’t attacked him and he couldn’t help but feel that those whispers were a beckoning, not a warning to stay away. Heading towards it might be foolish, but… above all, he didn’t want those lights at his back.

He kept opening doors along the way. Some of the rooms were so decayed that he couldn’t even guess what their use might have been. It did interest him that there was a library in this fortress, but he didn’t dare touch a book. If he opened one carelessly, it might fall apart. If it didn’t fall apart, he might wind up reading it. That would be even worse; he needed to get back to the village. This detour was already taking far too long. How long had he been wandering? An hour? Maybe even more.

One of the doors was stronger than the rest, made from metal rather than rotted wood. It took real effort to push this one open, not just because the hinges were one fused block of rust. A heavy door meant something worth protecting lay beyond. Hopefully a staircase up to the surface. After struggling for a few minutes, Arkk liberated an old sword from one of the nearby skeletons. Wedging that in the small opening he had made, he started prying the door open.

The sword snapped clean in two, throwing Arkk back as the counter to his weight vanished. He grimaced as his back hit the wall. Slumping down to the ground, Arkk took another short break, holding his hand to his injured hip. Jostling it with that little move hurt.

His efforts did not go to waste. Although the sword broke, it held strong long enough to leverage the door open. It wasn’t fully open but there was space to squeeze through.

There were no stairs inside, much to Arkk’s chagrin. Instead, it was almost the opposite. It was a large room. One of importance with large steps leading up to a dais in the dead center of the room. The dominating feature was a circular pit placed into the dais that seemed to go down forever. A large sphere, with deep grooves forming a maze-like pattern on its surface, looked like it had been knocked aside. Bodies littered the floor of this room more than any other, making it difficult to walk toward the center of the room. He had to take care, not wanting to trip and fall in.

Pulling another torch from a wall, lighting it, and dropping it down the deep pit, Arkk never saw it hit the bottom. The light just kept shrinking into the darkness until he couldn’t see it anymore.

Arkk backed up from the pit, sinking onto the steps leading up to the dais. It wasn’t a very comfortable place to sit. Deep grooves lined the floor and even the walls and ceiling of this room, creating a labyrinthine pattern that spread across every surface. He dropped his head into his hands. All the adrenaline and exhilaration that came from his mad sprint through the Cursed Forest had long since faded. Exhaustion crept into his bones. The injuries he sustained weren’t making it any easier.

This fortress was too large. There could be a stairwell beyond the door on the other side of this pit chamber or there could be yet another corridor. With as many doors as he had opened thus far, it almost felt like he *had* to stumble across a way up sooner or later. And yet, it felt like he was never going to escape. At what point would it be better to try stacking up furniture to reach that fissure versus continuing in the hopes of finding another way up?

It would have been nice if this fortress had a map somewhere. The tactical disadvantage of a map showing any intruders that saw it how to navigate this place meant that he doubted there would be one. Not to mention, it probably would have rotted away along with the bodies unless its creators carved it into the stone walls.

Arkk’s eyes drifted side to side. He had been avoiding looking too closely at the bodies throughout the ruins—it felt a bit morbid to stare at so many corpses—but now that his explorations had stalled, he couldn’t help but look at some of them.

He noticed now that they weren’t all humanoid. One was a partially crushed exoskeleton with a great many limbs, looking like a giant spider. Another had four arms and two legs. It was hard to tell what it might have looked like if it was more than just bones, but Arkk couldn’t think of a creature that had four arms. A skull a short distance from the rest of a humanoid body had horns. The oddest thing was a cube. A cube of folded layers of metal with long, sharp limbs jutting out at strange angles. Arkk had thought it was merely a sculpture until he realized that one of those sharp limbs was piercing the chest plate of a more humanoid-looking corpse. A battle-axe almost completely bisecting the cube must have been what killed it, but…

He had never seen anything like it.

Staring at it felt strange. Like it had too many angles for being a cube.

Tearing his eyes away, Arkk looked to a shadow in the room where a little golden light glinted in the darkness. For a moment, he thought it was a mere reflection of the torch off a suit of armor. It *blinking* dispersed that notion.

Arkk launched to his feet, noticing the room.

The entire half of the chamber changed while his back was turned. Dark shadows covered every surface despite his torch. Inside those shadows, stars burned bright, looking like dozens of eyes. Teeth gleamed in the darkness, forming dozens of mouths with lolling black tongues dangling from the shadows. The entire room stared at him.

Arkk’s dagger trembled in his fingers as he tried to steady himself. The room seeming to come alive into some kind of monster shook him. He just about ran. It would likely be useless given that he was trapped down here, but fight or flight instincts didn’t care about details like that.

Before he could, however, someone stepped out of the shadows. Some*thing*. It appeared as a woman, but obviously not human, elf, or even orc. No creature he had ever seen before had dark *violet* skin. Those same starry eyes that now possessed the rest of the room gleamed from its remarkably humanoid face. The majority of its clothes almost matched its skin, save for being a bit darker. A long white segment that ran down its entire front almost made it look like it was wearing an apron of sorts.

He quickly realized that its clothes weren’t clothes at all. They glistened and *dripped*. More of those golden eyes dotted the shoulders, stomach, wrists, and sides of its dress-like lower body.

This was a monster. Not like a simple orc or goblin, but a true *monster*. The kind spoken of in ancient tales from before the Calamity ravaged the lands.

And it was here. Staring at him from across the bottomless pit.

## 03 - Fortress Al-Mir


What did one do when confronted with a pre-Calamity monster?

Die. There wasn’t much more to it than that, Arkk figured. He would try to fight back. It was only natural. Looking at the creature before him, he had no doubts that his little dagger wouldn’t scratch a room-encompassing monster with *stars* for eyes. Even had he a proper sword or Ilya’s bow, making it angry was all he would accomplish.

And yet, it was a bit difficult to fight *back* when it wasn’t attacking in the first place. The eyes in the shadows of the room watched him, blinking occasionally. The blue-hued woman standing in the light simply *stood*. With its hands clasped together at its navel, just in front of another of those glowing yellow eyes, it watched him. Its head tilted to one side, ever so slightly, as if trying to decide what to make of him.

Legends and myths originating thousands of years ago said that aberrant, inhuman creatures once roamed the land. Great wars raged between armies of monsters, devouring all in their path. Arkk wasn’t sure if devouring was literal or a metaphor. Either way, this one didn’t seem particularly hungry. If it had been living in this fortress since the Calamity, or even in the last few months, it had never once bothered the village just a short trek to the east.

Was it trapped here? Arkk shook his head. Even discounting the fissure he had fallen through, this place wasn’t sealed off from the surface. He had spotted several such cracks in the ceiling, a few of which he had been able to see through to the surface.

The thing took a step. Step was probably the wrong word. It didn’t exactly have feet. Roiling tendrils of dark oil snaked across the ground beneath its dress… or whatever dress-like body it had. *Whatever* it did, it moved with glacial purpose as it rounded the large pit in the dais. Arkk immediately moved in the opposite direction, keeping the distance between them the same.

Though he quickly realized his folly. The shadows encompassing the rest of the room weren’t moving. If they swapped positions around the dais, its shadows would be at his back while it was at his front. Already, it was well within reach of the door he had pried open to get into this room.

Gnawing at his lip, Arkk decided that fighting would be impossible. But it wasn’t attacking and it had a humanoid face. Was talking a possibility?

“Hello?” Arkk said, trying to keep his voice from trembling too much. “Sorry for intruding on your, uh… home?”

It paused, stilling while still watching. The humanoid head canted to the side again. Its mouth opened as if to speak. “[Greetings]/[welcome]. [Long time]|[existence]|[witness]/[visitor]. [Who]|[why]/[purpose]? [Unknown human]|[seeking]|[treasure]/[riches]?”

The torch rolled back away from Arkk and his dagger clattered to the floor. He was not ready for what came forth from its mouth. Clamping his hands over his ears, he fought back tears. The thing spoke, which was a surprise on its own, but it didn’t speak in *words*. *Concepts* forced their way into Arkk’s mind.

“[Unknown human]|[seeking]|[power]/[force]/[domination]?”

“No,” Arkk said through clenched teeth. “No. I am looking for the way out.”

The monster cocked its head to the other side, taking another step around the dais in the process. “[Unknown human]|[abandon]/[flee]|[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]?”

It was all Arkk could do to remain standing, let alone move further away from the creature. Hands still pressed to his ears, he knew only one thing: It was open to conversation. To what end, he couldn’t say. But he had to try to plead his case.

“Please,” he said. “My village is under attack. I need to get out of here so I can warn them.”

“[Unknown human]|[seeking]|[protection]/[safety]?”

“Yes. Yes, that.”

“[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]|[ultimate]|[defensive tool]/[offensive tool].” The monster stepped closer. It was far enough around the dais to be on the same side. The tendrils squirming out from under its dress would be able to reach Arkk if they wanted. “[Contract]/[binding]/[agreement]?”

Arkk managed to stumble back, but the woman didn’t continue toward him. Instead, it turned away and moved toward the large stone sphere that had the same maze-like pattern across its surface that the rest of the room possessed. The sphere was taller than either of them but looked stuck inside a crater in the floor. The monster pressed its hand against the sphere’s side, though it didn’t bother trying to shove it out of that crater.

“[Contract]/[binding]/[agreement]?”

Arkk licked his dry lips. It didn’t help. The inside of his mouth was just as dry as the outside. “I don’t know what you’re asking. I need to get back to my village and warn them of an attack.”

“[Agreement]. [Contract]/[binding]|[offer]|[ultimate]|[defensive tool]/[offensive tool]. [Home]/[Sanctuary]|[rescue].” The creature turned away from the sphere, looking back to Arkk. It didn’t need to. Its hair, tied up in a high ponytail, had one of those golden suns peeking out from the thickest part. “[Abandon]/[flee]|[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]|[possible]/[unlikely]. [No exit]|[collapsed]. [Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[offer]|[assistance]. [Contract]/[binding]|[required].”

Arkk closed his eyes, feeling more than hearing the monster’s intention as he tried to parse the concepts it was shoving into his mind. There was no way out, at least not anymore. This monster would help, but only if he agreed to some kind of contract. Stacking up furniture to reach the fissure might still be an option unless this thing decided he wasn’t going to do what it wanted. At that point, it might get in the way. If not kill him outright.

“What is this contract?”

“[Offer]|[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]|[ultimate]|[defensive tool]/[offensive tool].”

“Yes. I got that much. What do *you* get?”

“[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]|[receive]|[restoration]/[refurbishment]/[beat]. [Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[receive]|[master]/[leader]/[warlord].”

“You want me to fix this place up?” That… didn’t sound so bad. This place was massive. It would be *work*, that was for sure. But sweeping out the dust and burying the bodies didn’t sound that horrible. Especially if the monster allowed him to browse the library. What the monster received sounded a bit dodgier, but still not horrible. It described itself as [SERVANT]. A concept filled with far more meaning than the simple word would imply. Despite the language forcing concepts into his mind, he couldn't quite comprehend what it meant. The basics, if he understood it correctly: It wanted someone to serve.

A faint smile touched the monster’s lips. It held out its hand, palm up. “[Agreement]?”

Arkk bit his lip. Did he have a choice?

There was always a choice. He could choose to throw himself into that deep pit. He could pick up his dagger and stab it into his own throat. He could choose to ignore the monster and face whatever consequences that would bring. None of those saved his village.

He didn’t know enough. He didn’t understand enough. It was too sudden. Arkk generally tried to find the best way to use any situation to his advantage but at the moment, his head was pounding too much to think properly.

“No.”

The smile faded. “[Disappointment].”

“I’m sorry. I’m having a hard time thinking with my village in danger.”

“[Defensive tool]. [Addition]/[bonus reward]|[self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[strong]/[weight-lifting champion].”

“Yes, I understand that. But it is just a few orcs and goblins. We’ve handled worse. As long as I ready the villagers before the orcs arrive, as long as people aren’t caught out working in the fields, we’ll be fine without…” Arkk glanced at the large sphere. “Whatever that is.”

He didn’t know what it was. The monster could say whatever it wanted to say. Making a contract with some ancient artifact sounded like a good way to get his soul eaten by a demon. He had never heard of such a thing happening, but Arkk would be the first to admit that he was a country peasant with no formal instruction in anything beyond hunting and farming. Even that didn’t count as *formal*.

The Abbess of Langleey’s church warned of such things in her sermons. Not *exactly* like this. Demons were known to prey upon ignorant or deviant individuals, offering anything from wealth to skills to revenge in exchange for payments that sounded a lot more innocent than they truly were. Demons were monsters possessing ultimate antipathy for mortals. Making a contract with one was *only* done by the most foolish of beings. Or so went the teachings of the church. Arkk had never met one.

He didn’t particularly want to.

Tidying up this fortress didn’t sound like any demon deal the Abbess had mentioned, not that she had ever been particularly specific, but it did sound like just the sort of thing that would come with hidden strings attached.

“Please,” Arkk said. “Help me out of here. I’ll even come back if that is what you want. I'll help clean this place up a bit. But not while I’m distracted with my village’s problems.”

“[Return]?”

“Yes. Return.”

“[Contract]/[binding]|[HEART]?”

“No.”

It was a fairly selfish promise. Assuming he worked up the guts to go through with it. The library interested him enough that, as long as this monster wasn’t going to eat him, he would almost certainly try to come back. He had only taken a brief glimpse into that library, but at least some of the books inside were surely magical. He was fairly certain he had seen the arcane symbol on the spine of one.

Learning magic, even with this thing hanging over his shoulders, was worth dragging a broom out here to sweep out the corridors.

“[Understanding]. [Extract]|[promise]/[word of honor].”

“Uh… sure? I promise to return here if you help me get back to my village.”

“[Acceptable]|[terms]. [Contract]/[binding]|[temporary]/[on hold]/[stay of execution].” The monster stepped away from the large sphere. “[Follow]/[good boy].” It turned and began gliding toward the door he had pried open. The way it moved on its pillar of tendrils was disturbing. Even worse was the way the entire room seemed to shift; the oily shadows filled with eyes and mouths swept around Arkk, flowing *into* the monster as it walked.

Keeping his eyes on the creature, Arkk bent and retrieved his dropped dagger and the still-burning torch.

The monster laid a hand on the metal door, throwing it open with no obvious effort despite how much he had strained in getting it open. They arrived at the library in short order. Arkk felt like it had been an hour from the library to the maze chamber the first time, but only a few minutes to get back. It did help a bit that he wasn’t opening every door on the way, but it still felt faster than before.

The monster had said that the exit was blocked. Maybe even down that collapsed passage he had started near. Still, he expected some other way out. Instead, he found himself led to a small table beyond the shelves of musty books where a dusty crystal ball sat atop a small platform. The monster swept her hand over it, clearing the dust, then motioned for him.

“[Display]/[imagination]|[home].”

Arkk stared at the glass ball. He had heard about such devices. The Abbey and sorcerers used them for communication. Even that spellcaster who visited the village several months back carried a small one. He knew of them. He had no idea how they worked.

Seeing his helpless state, the monster took his hands. They glistened in the torchlight but didn’t feel wet or cold at all. There was a gentle warmth to its fingers. It held his hands just over the top of the crystal ball, not touching, but close enough that he could almost feel the cool glass. “[Display]/[imagination]|[village]/[peasantry]. [Sanctuary]. [Leaser]/[property owner]/[landlord]. [Eating hall]/[restaurant]. [Livestock]/[field]/[grocery store].”

A white mist occluded the clear glass as the monster spoke. The concepts thrust into Arkk’s mind brought up thoughts and memories without him even trying to think too hard. When the farm came up, Arkk drew in a breath. With it came the scent of freshly cut wheat, the mint fields, and the less pleasant smell of livestock. The mist shimmered, changing to show the village’s fields, lit only by moonlight. Despite the darkness, he recognized the layout and the paths. Up the shallow hill were their local church, a large storehouse, and a nearby barn.

The servant took over, shooing his hands off to the sides. With one of its hands pointed toward the crystal ball, the image began flickering, snapping inside homes, out in the fields, and around the main church building. Eventually the view changed to display an image so high up that he could see the river and the Cursed Forest beyond. A few jarring snaps through the Cursed Forest before Arkk saw himself looking at his own head of brown hair, hunched over a crystal ball in a decrepit library.

He glanced upward, but there was nothing above that indicated a watcher’s presence.

“[Understanding].”

The words brought his gaze back down. The monster’s starfield-like eyes stared into his own, bright yellow suns dominating. “Understand?”

“[Location]/[coordinates]|[understanding]. [Please hold]/[stay of execution]. [Problem]/[concern].”

Arkk narrowed his eyes. The serene face of the monster didn’t flinch in the slightest. Why should it? It wasn’t human and it could probably crush him if it took a sudden dislike to him. And yet, he couldn’t help but glare. “You said you would help.”

“[Assistance]|[agreement],” it said, pointing a lithe finger toward the crystal ball. The image of the village church shimmered into position. “[Problem]/[concern]. [Symbol]/[regalia]/[scribble]|[Almighty Glory]|[Heart of Gold]|[Holy Light].”

Arkk blinked again, this time in confusion over the unfamiliar names. He was fairly sure those were names, anyway. “So… what?”

“[Understanding].” It seemed pleased, offering a smile. “[Disuse]/[abandoned]?”

“No, the Abbess leads sermons every Suun.”

“[Confusion]? [Foreign]/[not us].”

“I… I have no idea what you’re trying to say,” Arkk said. This was a monster. He wasn’t sure what the church had to do with anything. Despite the odd way the thing spoke, he thought they were communicating rather well until now.

The monster jerked its head in a confused twitch. “[Ignore this message]. [Promise]/[word of honor]|[reminder]/[nudge-nudge].” Tendrils swept out from under the creature’s long dress, shoving aside bones, armor, and weapons with no reverence or care. Books, however, were plucked from the pile and carefully set apart, much to Arkk’s relief.

Within the now-emptied space, the monster’s tentacles began working, leaving trails of black slime where there had been none before. Its normal walking and even that careless clearing didn’t leave slime behind, so this had to be intentional. As Arkk watched, he quickly realized that it was forming some kind of magical circle in the ground. A complex one, far more complex than any he had seen before. And this monster was doing it all without turning its head away from him.

Eerie.

“Your name is Vezta, isn’t it?” Arkk said, desperate to focus on something else. “I think that is what I got while you were talking about… contracts.”

“[Inaccurate]. [Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]. [Inadequate]/[sorry state]|[language]. Vezta|[acceptable].”

“Oh. Good then,” Arkk said before an awkward silence fell over them. It was made all the more awkward by the way that Vezta simply did not blink. He had seen the eyes in the shadows blink before, but never the eyes on its face. Emboldened by her answering his question, Arkk asked another. “If you don’t mind me asking, what kind of monster are you? I’ve never seen something like you before.”

“[SERVANT].” The self-proclaimed servant stepped aside, bowing while holding one hand out toward the freshly drawn magic circle. “[Existence]|[relocate]/[walk away]/[walk inside]. [Mind the edges].”

“You want me inside the circle?”

The monster bowed deeply, upper body nearly parallel to the ground.

Arkk looked to the circle, wary. He couldn’t even begin to imagine what the circle was for. Just following the channels, veins, and magical pathways made him dizzy.

Sensing his hesitation, the monster took hold of his hand again and slowly brought him over. “[Safety]/[bodily integrity]|[assured]. [No]|[error]/[flub].”

“Ah, what, exactly does this—”

Arkk didn’t get to finish. The monster took a step back, out of the circle, leaving him in its center. The circle flashed and cold night air soaked into his tunic. He blinked a few times, confused at the library’s absence. Somehow, he was outside, standing on a dirt path. He was just around the back of the carpenter’s shop, between the building and the riverbank. The familiar sound of the water rushing past the locked waterwheel filled his ears.

This was it. His home. Langleey Village.

He was back. That quickly? Did all spellcasters know how to do something like that?

Arkk put the thought out of his mind. Even with the hours spent exploring that fortress, he was back long before he would have been if he had simply kept running. Those hours couldn’t go to waste. Drawing in a deep breath, he turned and sprinted toward the Baron of Langleey’s manor.

---

## 04 - Langleey Village


Gert Freede, Baron of Langleey, made his home in the center of the village square, just across from the church. It wasn’t a particularly large manor. Arkk had been to other villages and burgs where their local lords of the land had miniature castles. Gert lived a simple life, not far elevated from the serfs employed to work the farms. The grounds were far more elaborate than the house, being one large garden tended to by Gert’s wife and a few others. The wide lanes of strawberries were a much-beloved treat during the times of the year when they grew in.

Rushing through that garden, Arkk reached the large wooden doors of the Baron’s home and started hammering the knocker.

It was the dead of night. Well before anyone would be awake. Arkk didn’t expect anyone to answer right away. It took a few minutes of hammering before the door creaked open.

A short, round man with rosy round cheeks and a round nose pulled open the door, standing with a small rushlight burning in his hands. The light from the miniature candle paled in comparison to the larger torch that Arkk still held. Gert raised a hand, blocking the light from the torch as he squinted into the darkness.

“What is the meaning of this? Have you any idea—”

“Sorry to wake you, sir. I thought you would want to know that orcs and goblins were spotted near the village.”

Gert sucked in a breath, free hand clutching at his pale yellow nightgown as the rushlight drifted to the ground. “Goblins? Here?”

“In the company of orcs,” Arkk said.

Goblins were by far the more alarming threat. Vicious little creatures, more akin to wild animals than proper beings. Orcs, on their own, were generally treated with suspicion but could be open for trade while passing through on whatever business orcs got up to. Orcs in the company of goblins, however, was bad news. Raiders and scavengers, the lot of them.

“How many? How far off?”

Arkk shook his head. “Not sure, exactly. Ilya and I spotted tracks. She counted at least four orcs. I’d guess maybe twice as many goblins. They always outnumber the orcs in these kinds of groups. As for how far off?” He didn’t have a proper answer for that. “I’d guess they could be here as early as dawn if they’re heading straight here.”

“You and Ilya?” Gert said, squinting his beady eyes. “Arkk?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You were hunting out west, beyond the Cursed Forest?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Where is Ilya?” Arkk hesitated. The brief pause made Gert grimace. “Oh, no… is she—”

“No, no. She should be safe. We took different routes back. Wanted to make sure that one of us made it just in case the horde got the other. She took a route that kept her closer to the orcs and goblins. I imagine her arrival will mean we’ve run out of time.”

Relief crossed Gert’s face. The fingers clenching his nightgown relaxed some. “Good. Very good. I understand. Rush to the church and sound the bells. Wake the village. We’ll gather everyone who can fight and hide the rest in my manor.”

Time being of the essence, Arkk didn’t bother saying anything else. He turned and rushed across the small plaza to the church.

In contrast to the Baron’s rather simple home, barely more affluent than any villager’s home, the church had opulence to it. It and the smithy were the only fully stone structures in the village. Where the smithy had a rugged design, the church was smooth and tall. High windows brought in natural light to the main chapel area. Whitewashed walls gleamed in the moonlight while the golden symbols inscribed on its bell tower sparkled with whatever light they could catch.

The door wasn’t locked. Although it had heavy bolts, it was never locked. The bell tower hung over the entrance, just before the main chapel. A door to the side let him into the bell room where, after dropping his torch on the stone floor, he set to pulling on the thick ropes.

Despite the gravity of the situation, pulling down on the ropes reminded him of when he was a boy, fighting with Ilya over who got to ring the bells before the Suun sermon. He had heard the bells ring in emergencies like this before, but had never done it himself. Still, he couldn’t help but smile when he heard that heavy *bong*.

Arkk didn’t know for how long he should ring the bell, so he kept going. The *entire* village didn’t need to wake up from the bell ringing, just enough people. Those who were awake could then wake their neighbors.

A few *bongs* turned into a few dozen before Arkk felt a hand resting on his shoulder. The Abbess stood behind him, wearing a grim smile that wrinkled her face more than usual.

“Thank you, Arkk. You can stop now.”

Arkk immediately let go of the rope. “Right. Enough people up?”

“The Baron is organizing everyone in the plaza now, repeating what you said.” Abbess Keena fiddled with her habit, smoothing out the wrinkles. Arkk was honestly surprised she was wearing it at a time like this. Pure white with elegant golden thread marking symbols into it, it was probably the single most opulent article of clothing in the entire village. Not even the Baron wore such expensive threads when viscounts or earls were visiting. “Are there really goblins approaching?” she asked.

“There… is a chance they weren’t headed toward the village,” Arkk said slowly. “Ilya and I were on the other side of the Cursed Forest when we noticed them. They seemed to be following the forest’s edge. We couldn’t take the chance that they *weren’t* coming here.”

“Of course not,” the Abbess said, face turning grim. “I shall pray they pass us by, but will prepare my salves and prayers for healing.”

Before Keena could turn and leave, Arkk tugged up his tunic. “Could you take a look at this first?” he asked, wincing as he looked down at his wound for the first time. Long jagged lines of torn flesh ran from his hip to his ribs amid raw, red skin. It wasn’t bleeding, but thin streaks of blood showed that it had been when he received it. Seeing it made it start stinging all over again. “It looks worse than it is,” he said quickly, not sure if he was trying to reassure the frowning abbess or himself. “Took a bit of a tumble in my hurry to get back.”

“I can apply an ointment, but I need to keep my healing prayers ready for more grievous injuries.”

“Prayer would be more than I need,” he said, flashing a smile. “Just want to fight without distraction.”

The Abbess brought him through the chapel, sitting him down on one of the pews before disappearing through a door behind the altar. She returned in short order, carrying a small clay jar. Arkk wrinkled his nose at the fish-like smell when she pulled out the wax stopper but didn’t complain as she rolled up her sleeves and gently applied a thin layer of the freezing gel to his side.

“Abbess Keena?” Arkk said as she worked. “Might I ask a question of… religious nature?”

The older woman let out a soft laugh. “That is what I am here for.”

“I… What do demons look like?”

The Abbess jerked her hand, smacking into the clay pot. Arkk snapped his hand forward, catching it just before it rolled off the pew.

“Sorry… I shouldn’t have asked.”

“No, that is what I’m here for,” she said again, far less humor in her voice this time. “Why do you ask?”

Arkk bit his lip. “I might have taken a shortcut through the Cursed Forest to warn the village faster,” he said, wincing at the way her eyebrows popped up and wrinkled her forehead. He continued, speaking faster and faster with every word to get his confession out of the way as quickly as possible. “There was something out there. A monster, I think. I’ve never seen anything like it before. I think it wanted me to agree to something—it didn’t exactly speak any proper language so it was a bit hard to tell. I said no,” he added, words spilling out of his mouth as fast as he could to deny agreeing to anything. “Then it just let me go. I wasn’t sure what to think of the encounter.”

To his surprise, Abbess Keena seemed to relax the more he talked. She even started moving again, hands rubbing the ointment into his side. “Doesn’t sound like a demon then,” she said slowly, thinking. “Demons typically look like people, at least when attempting to engage in such a conversation, to better deceive those with whom they would make deals. Something unlike anything you had ever seen would not be a demon.”

“Typically? But not always?”

Keena glanced up, brows scrunched together. “I don’t exactly have personal experience, Arkk.”

“No. No, of course not.”

“Apart from that,” she continued, “it is well-known that demons can speak any language with perfect fluency. Demons cannot lie while making deals. Garbling their deal with another language would violate that, I imagine. Therefore, it couldn’t have been a demon.” Pulling away from Arkk, Keena dried her fingers with a small cloth before recapping the jar of ointment. She stood, and paused. “What did it ask of you?”

“It wasn’t *perfectly* clear. I think it wanted three things,” Arkk said, straightening out his tunic. “First, it wanted help cleaning up some ruins I fell into.”

“Ruins? In the Cursed Forest?”

“Some old fortress. Looked really old. Maybe pre-Calamity. Frankly, I think the monster might have been pre-Calamity too. It looked like some kind of slimy, tentacle monstrosity with a few too many eyes.”

“A creature from before the Calamity?” the Abbess asked, actually sounding amused. “It has been over a millennium. Only dragons and elves live that long and this doesn’t sound like either.”

“I’m just saying,” Arkk mumbled, “it would fit the stories.”

“The other things it asked of you?”

“Well, there was some kind of large magical object in those ruins. A giant ball. I think it wanted me to take it.”

“Just give it to you?”

Arkk shrugged. “Finally, it kept calling itself a servant. And I think it wanted someone to serve.”

Keena pressed her lips together. “Peculiar.”

“Doesn’t sound familiar?”

“I am hardly a walking index of monsters, Arkk. I’m just a remote village’s religious guide. I dare say that the mercenaries who pass through on occasion would be of better assistance in identifying your mysterious creature. A magical artifact is more concerning. It could be what is causing the corruption in the Cursed Forest.” She hummed. “I should prepare a cleansing ritual for you later. Getting so close to this artifact… If it is what is causing the corruption, removing or destroying it might be a worthy endeavor. If we could reclaim the Cursed Forest, Langleey might enter into a new age of prosperity.”

“The creature called the artifact a defensive and offensive tool, though it wasn’t more clear than that.”

Keena furrowed her brow, squinting as she stared off into one of the large glass windows of the chapel. “That… sounds familiar.” She tapped the jar of ointment against her chin a few times before shaking her head. “I can’t recall. After our current crisis is over, I shall delve through the Holy Tome and see if I’m imagining familiarity or if I’ve heard of that before.”

“Current crisis,” Arkk mumbled, closing his eyes and wishing he could forget about that. His eyelids were heavy enough that he couldn’t quite open them right away. The Baron would take care of things right now. He didn’t have anything else to say about the goblins and orcs. There was still much he could do, but trying to put effort into his legs just didn’t quite work. Exhaustion kept him still.

A short rest would help him fight all the more.

He hoped Ilya was alright.

***

The warm light from the morning sun streamed through the tall windows of the church, stirring Arkk from his rest. The warmth felt nice, peaceful, and serene. Too peaceful, even. Like he was missing something.

Snapping his eyes open, Arkk jolted to his feet, remembering what daylight meant. He was still in the chapel. Abbess Keena must have left him to rest. While thankful for the brief respite, Arkk wished she wouldn’t have let him sleep quite this long. Rushing out to the square, Arkk set about learning what was going on.

The village had assembled. Of the seventy people in their village,  twelve men and eight women had taken up arms. Six teens strong enough to carry bows had been recruited as well, positioned atop roofs to act as lookouts. Their eyes were on the west, toward the Cursed Forest. The large fields of corn would obstruct the sightlines, unfortunately, with it being so close to harvest. The church and manor up on the hill would hopefully provide enough elevation to spot unnatural rustling to give an early warning.

“Where is Ilya?” Arkk called out, running through the assembled defenders. She was supposed to arrive by dawn… unless she had taken to her fallback plan of distracting the orcs and goblins so that Arkk would have a chance to arrive first. Unnecessary now, but she didn’t know that. “Has anyone seen Ilya?”

A hand grasped hold of the back of his tunic as he slowed, jerking him to a stop.

“Quiet down, boy. You’ll cause a panic.”

The man holding onto Arkk gave him a dark look as he spun him around. An older man with thin clouds of white hair might not have intimidated a young man like Arkk, but this was John, the village carpenter. Wearing a worn gambeson with a heavy lumber axe strapped to his side and a powerful longbow slung over his shoulder, he was probably the most intimidating man in the village.

“Have you seen Ilya? Did she make it back?”

“No one has seen the lass. I’m sure you’d be the first to know.” John took a deep breath, softening his expression. “Now what’s all this about goblins?”

“Didn’t the Baron—”

“I want to hear it from you, boy.”

“Ilya and I found a handful of orcs and goblins, we were—”

“Hey! Arkk!”

Fighting the grimace off his face, Arkk turned toward the new voice. “Jorgen. Hurtt,” he said to the two approaching him. Both were burly men with arms thicker than tree trunks. Neither had a pleasant look on their face.

“Got any magic for us today?” Jorgen said.

“No, I—”

“Course he doesn’t,” Hurtt said with an ugly scoff. “The one time explosions might be useful and he doesn’t have anything.”

“Oi, shove off,” John said. “You got time to flap your lips, you got time to keep a lookout.”

The two laughed as they turned away. Arkk followed them with his eyes, watching the way they kept their smiles and seeming amusement only until they were a short distance away, at which point they dropped the act entirely, shooting each other glances.

“They’re just nervous,” Arkk said.

“We all are. Waking us up so early in the night?” John gave a tired shake of his head then let out a mighty yawn. “Could have slept in for another few hours.”

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine. Besides, you’ll show them up. Hit a few goblins between the eyes. Who needs unreliable magic and chanting when you’ve got…” John blinked, frowning as he looked over Arkk. “Where’s your gear, boy? You can’t fight like that.”

“It’s out in the Cursed Forest,” Arkk said with a groan, running a hand down his face. “They were too heavy and I needed to run.”

“You left your lady-friend’s bow in the *Cursed Forest*? I take it back. You’re going to be dead the moment she walks up.”

“I remember where it is!” *I hope*. “I can get it back after we fight off the attack.”

John looked off into the distance, then snapped his eyes back to Arkk. “Not going to be fighting off anything like that. Run down to my shop. There should be two bows hanging on the rack near the wheel. Neither will be as good as an elf’s bow, but at least you won’t be useless.”

“Sorry,” Arkk said, starting away. He paused and glanced back. “Thanks!”

John just threw his hand in a dismissive motion.

Hurrying down the hill, back to the side of the river, Arkk threw open the door to John’s workshop. A pair of wagon wheels leaned against one wall. The start of a bedframe sat atop the main workbench, surrounded by all manner of metal tools. The opposite wall from the door had what Arkk was looking for. Two bows hung next to the door out to the lumber saw and the waterwheel. One was missing its string. Not knowing where John kept bowstrings, Arkk picked up the other and tested its weight.

It was quite a bit heavier than Ilya’s bow, but it would work. Of course, a bow wouldn’t do much on its own. John *had* to have some arrows around somewhere. Arkk started pulling open workbench drawers and searching shelves.

Arkk felt a rush of wind and a *thunk* at his back. Whirling, he found an arrow, end vibrating, sticking out from a cabinet along the wall.

“That one,” a voice whispered.

“Hale?” Arkk said, looking to the door to find a young lady hanging upside-down from the roof. Her twin-tailed hair hung down, giving her the comical appearance of a giant beetle, but her piercing green eyes betrayed her seriousness. A much smaller bow hung from her arms. “What are you doing?”

“You were looking for arrows,” she said, unblinking. “Headed and fletched arrows are in that cupboard.”

The arrow sticking out of the cupboard bit into it right along the grain. Grabbing hold of it, he wrenched it from the door. In doing so, half the door fell to the floor with a clatter. She was right, there were completed arrows inside, but… “How are you going to explain this to John?”

Her eyes went wide. They darted left, then right, then back to Arkk. “Goblins did it.”

“They aren’t even here yet.”

“Goblins did it,” she said again, voice firm. Reaching up to whatever she was hanging from, she started to pull herself up, only to let out a small, “Ah!” before falling straight down onto her back.

She was on her feet before Arkk could get over to her, but he still grabbed her arms to help steady her. In contrast to her steady voice, her arms were trembling. “Why are you out here? Everyone else is up near the plaza.”

“Guarding the shop,” she answered, yanking her arms from Arkk’s hands.

“It’s dangerous on your own. Did John tell you to do this? I’ll—”

“No! I have to stay here. Master is too old. If the goblins burn this place down—”

“Then the whole village will help rebuild it. You think John cares more about a few planks of wood than his apprentice?” Arkk flicked her forehead between her brows. “Can you even draw that bow back?”

Rubbing between her eyes, Hale scowled. “I hit the cupboard door right where I was aiming, while upside down.”

Arkk glanced back, then to the arrow still in his hand. “So you did. Maybe you can help then, but *with everyone else*. Not out here on your own.”

After gathering up a number of the arrows into a sack that Hale found for him—they didn’t have a proper quiver handy and he had left everything with his other equipment—Arkk started dragging Hale out of the workshop.

“Wait!” Hale said, stopping abruptly. The little girl grabbed his hand and pulled. “I remembered. I wanted you to see something.”

“You wanted *me* to see something?”

“You know magic, right?” she asked, dragging him around the shop. Arkk didn’t have a good answer for her, affirmative or negative, so he kept his mouth shut. “What’s this?”

Arkk blinked, looking where she was pointing. There was a magic circle *burned* into the ground, the same one Vezta had drawn out in the library. The one that had brought him here. Intricate and complex, and yet, it was perfectly clear right there in the dirt. “Do… do you have a sheet of paper handy?” he asked. “And something to scrawl with?”

He didn’t know if it would survive the coming battle and he so desperately wanted to figure out how that worked. Magic that moved people great distances? It was too good to be true. If they could move from the village past the Cursed Forest without having to walk or ride the distance, they would be able to hunt and forage and chop lumber so much easier than they could now.

Hale returned, bringing with her a rough piece of pulpy paper and a thin stick of charcoal. Not ideal, but it would work. “Keep an eye out for goblins or orcs. And Ilya too.”

“Why Ilya? She’s right there?”

“Yes, keep an eye—” Registering what Hale said, Arkk snapped his head up.

A lithe elf ran along the bank of the river, eyes up on the church. She looked worn, covered in far more grime than when Arkk had last seen her. It was as if she had crawled through a pit of mud on her stomach.

“Ilya!” Arkk called, waving the paper.

He could see her eyes widening even from the distance. The silver in them gleamed in the morning light. Seeing him must have given her a new wind. Her pace picked up as she headed straight toward him.

“What are you doing here?” she shouted, voice rough and scratchy. Sweat dripped from her face and stained her clothes in all the places where the mud wasn’t caked on. “Did you… Did you go through the Cursed Forest? After I said…” She trailed off as she got closer, shooting a wary glare at the magic circle on the ground. “What is *that*?”

“It’s, uh…”

“Never mind,” she snapped, shaking her head and sending her knife-like ears bouncing. “We need to go.”

“Go where? I already warned the village. Including the youth, we have just under thirty people ready to fight.”

“Not enough,” Ilya said, shaking her head. “It isn’t just a handful. There is a whole army out there. Maybe an hour behind me at most. I could have been here sooner, but I wanted to see what we were dealing with. Good thing too. That group that attacked the stag was just a small scouting group. The larger force has thirty to fifty orcs, with a half-dozen goblins to each. No idea how many other scouting groups there might have been.”

Arkk staggered back. “What? That’s… about two hundred? Minimum. How are they wandering in such a large group without the Duke hunting them down?”

“I don’t know, but we can’t be here.”

“But… where?”

“I don’t know,” she said again, grinding her teeth together. “The monsters will see the village, or their scouts will. It won’t be long before they come down on it. Pillaging it will buy us time to move, but only if we start *now*.”

“It’s almost harvest,” Arkk said, leaning against the carpentry wall. “They’ll burn whatever crops they don’t want. Loot the storehouse. Slaughter the livestock they don’t take… How are we—”

Something hard smacked into the side of Arkk’s face. “Pull yourself together! Everything is already lost. If we don’t want to die with the village, we need to go.” She stepped past him, looking around the wall of the carpentry up toward the church. “We’ll flee to the Duke. He will have to take action against these monsters. Then… we just have to hope he takes pity on us and opens Cliff’s storehouses.”

“Flee to the Duke? You can’t go to the Duke. *You* can’t go to the Duke, Ilya. He’ll—”

“What other option do we have?” she snapped. “If it is for the village, I can make sacrifices. Just as my mother did.” Teeth clenched, she took off, running toward the church.

Arkk had never met the Duke before. As far as he knew, the Duke didn’t visit the various villages in his fiefdom. He did send collectors for tax and tribute. Every year, they wanted money, food, livestock… and rarely women. Ilya’s mother. Though ancient by human standards, she appeared beautiful and young. At least, that was what Arkk remembered. He had been a mere boy when she had *volunteered* herself as tribute during a year of poor harvest.

Volunteered herself to save Ilya from that fate.

She had never returned to Langleey. Arkk didn’t even know for sure if she was still alive.

With all the other tax the Duke collected, his storehouses should be plentiful, if not overflowing. Theoretically, he had more than enough to give to displaced refugees.

Arkk clenched his teeth.

“What are you doing?” a trembling, frightened voice asked.

Arkk stepped forward, standing in the center of the circle burned into the ground. With a smile, he reached out and ran a hand between Hale’s twin ponytails, messing up her hair. “I’m going to get help?”

“Help?”

“It’s okay,” Arkk said, drawing in a shaky breath. He spoke more to himself than to the young carpenter’s apprentice. “The Abbess said it wasn’t a demon. It’s not a demon.”

Hale jolted, alarm obvious on her young face.

“Stay with Ilya. *Don’t* try to protect the shop all on your own. If they leave, you leave with them.”

Giving her a light shove to make sure the young girl was clear of the circle, Arkk knelt and pushed just a touch of his magic into its channels and pathways.

The circle flashed and Arkk found himself plunged into total darkness.

## 05 - Contract


Of course it was dark. This was an underground library with no natural lighting. He hadn’t brought his torch with him.

“Vezta?” he called out. Not receiving an answer, he carefully started moving, feeling his way to the door. If he remembered correctly, the maze-like room with the bottomless pit would be to his right. “Vezta?” he called again as he made his way as fast as he could in the total darkness. A few times, he stumbled over the bodies of the fallen soldiers or monsters, but he pushed on until he felt the heavy metal door.

Turning the corner into the pit room, he found Vezta seated on the steps of the dais. It looked like it had one knee crossed over the other, but the only things peeking out the bottom of its ‘dress’ were thick, black tendrils that dripped with slime. He wasn’t quite sure how he could see the monster—there were no visible torches in the room—but there it was.

Maybe it had something to do with the way he couldn’t see anything but darkness in the rest of the room. No starfields with bright yellow suns peeking out at him this time.

The creature smiled, flashing surprisingly human-like teeth. “[Defense]|[successful]/[victorious]?”

Arkk grimaced as the strange concepts formed in his mind, but this time, he refrained from clamping his hands over his ears. It hadn’t helped last time.

“No. It hasn’t started yet. I…” His eyes shifted to the side where he spotted one other thing despite the total darkness of the room. The large stone sphere, engraved with the same labyrinthine pattern that covered the rest of the chamber. “There are a lot more than expected, it seems.”

“[Misfortune]|[lament]/[mourn]. [Unknown human]|[presence]/[continued existence]|[query]?”

“Yeah. I’m back.” He looked to the sphere. “This thing. You said it is a defensive tool?”

“[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]. [Ultimate]|[defensive tool]/[offensive tool]. [Confirmation]/[no fibbing].”

“There are two hundred creatures, a few dozen orcs with the rest being goblins, approaching my village.” Arkk paused, considering his words. “Can it stop them? Fight them off?”

Vezta cocked her head to one side, hand scratching behind its ear. It *seemed* to swap which legs were crossed, but again, nothing but a writhing mass of tentacles came out the bottom of its clothing. “[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]|[require]|[construction]/[embedding]/[fortification]. [Require]|[temporal passage]/[tick-tock]. [Require]|[underlings]/[minions]/[employees].”

“Is that… is that a no?” Arkk clenched his teeth. “What about you? You look strong, can you—”

Vezta held up a finger. “[Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[bound]/[tethered]|[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART].”

“You’re stuck here?”

“[Bound]/[tethered]|[HEART]. [Unknown human]|[contract]/[binding]|[HEART]; [Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[bound]/[tethered]|[unknown human].”

“If I…” Arkk started, trying to parse its meaning. “If I do your contract thing with the heart, you’ll be bound to me? And then we can both leave this place?”

“[Confirmation].”

“*Can* you take out two hundred monsters?”

Vezta considered again before slowly nodding its head. “[Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[serves]/[delivers tea]. [Conflict]/[barroom brawl]![specialty]. [Possible]. [Out of practice]/[rust-covered blade].”

“Please just say yes or no.”

“Yes or no.” It paused, then frowned. “Yes.”

“Good enough for me,” Arkk said, marching over to the sphere. “How do I do this?”

Vezta was at his side before he even noticed it move. It took his hand in its own—warm and not slimy despite looking like it should be—and gently moved him closer to the massive stone sphere. “[Magic]|[push]/[saturate].”

Arkk blinked. For some reason—tales of old, he suspected—he thought there would be a literal contract to sign. Something requiring his signature. Instead, the monster guided his hand until his palm met the cool, rough stone of the sphere. “You aren’t a demon, right?” he asked, wanting just a little more confirmation than the Abbess had been able to give.

To his surprise, Vezta gnashed her teeth. Her hand squeezed his just a bit too tight, making him wince. “[Offended]/[insulted]. [Deceiver]/[scam artist]?” It scoffed a clear and uncannily human-like scoff. “[Self]/[Vezta]/[SERVANT]|[SERVANT]. [SERVANT].”

As Vezta slowly relaxed its grip on his hand, Arkk decided to never bring that subject up again for as long as he lived. “I… most times I try to use magic, I blow up whatever I’m trying to do,” Arkk admitted. “Just a warning.”

“[Unknown human]|[powerful]/[terrific]. [HEART]|[desires]|[power]/[magic]. [Positive quality]/[good job].”

“Alright, I guess. Just don’t blame me when it explodes.”

The monster said nothing more. Taking a deep breath, Arkk focused on the sphere. Gently touching it with his magic, he could feel its channels and pathways. The labyrinthine design carved into its surface tugged at his magic. Like one massive ritual circle, impossibly complex compared to anything he had seen, let alone used.

The tugging continued, pulling more. Arkk tried to rear back, only to find the tug grow stronger. It ripped at his magic, siphoning more and more. He tried to rip his hand off the sphere itself, but the monster kept him pinned to it.

His fingertips started to burn. The heat spread across his palm. Throwing his head back, Arkk couldn’t stop the scream welling in his throat.

The sphere ejected a great *thump*, moving despite its stone nature. The force of it sent Arkk flying backward, breaking his contact with the artifact as he sailed across the room. His back slammed into the wall and his vision swam.

Before the tunnel vision took over completely, he saw the monster turn to him with a too-wide smile stretching across its face. “Contract accepted,” it said as the torches mounted on the walls flared to life.

Arkk’s head slumped and everything went dark.

***

Arkk wasn’t quite sure when he awoke. All he knew was that it was the most comfortable waking he had ever experienced. Ilya always knew how to stuff her mattress to make it comfortable, but compared to this? Arkk imagined he had fallen asleep on a cloud.

That… couldn’t be right.

Slowly opening his eyes to flickering yet bright torchlight, he jolted.

A pair of bright gold eyes stared down at him, looking like two suns hanging in a pitch-black night sky.

“Welcome back.”

Arkk leaped to his feet and backed away slowly. The monster sat on the ground, shadows and tendrils spread out across the floor where he had been. As far as he could tell, his head had been resting on its… thighs? If it had such things. The way those tendrils disappeared back into its body made him doubt it.

It stood in an inhumanly smooth motion, hands clasped in front of its navel once again. But Arkk found his attention drawn away from the monster.

The room had changed during his unconsciousness. There were still skeletons strewn about, but the torches had come to life. The crater that had held the sphere was empty. Now, the sphere floated over the bottomless pit, slowly revolving. Every few seconds, a thump-thump resounded throughout the chamber, sounding like the beating of a heart.

Which answered the question of why the monster had called this a [HEART].

Magical light traced paths through the sphere’s maze. Magic that he could *feel* as it coursed over the heart. The feeling made him nervous. His heart beat faster. So too did the stone heart, increasing the rate of the heavy thumps.

That…

He wasn’t sure what to make of that.

“Fortress Al-Mir lives again.”

Arkk turned his head, though his eyes lingered on the beating stone heart until her words forced him to shift focus to the monster. “I understood you?”

“It would be more accurate to say that the [HEART] informed me of your language, which I am now speaking.” Keeping its hands clasped together, the monster dipped into a low bow. “I apologize for the pain the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE] caused you, but I had no other method of communication.”

“I…” Arkk didn’t quite know how to respond to a monster sincerely apologizing to him. Clenching his teeth, he shook his head. “How long was I out?”

“Approximately one hour.”

Arkk’s heart threatened to leap up his throat at hearing that. The thumps in the chamber picked up the pace, making him all the more aware of his own hammering heart.

“Something wrong?”

“We need to hurry. They might already be there by now. You…” Arkk looked at Vezta, pausing. “You can fight them, right?”

“I can try.” Vezta tilted its head back and forth like it was cracking the bones in its neck. If a creature that dripped with slime and walked on tentacles had anything resembling a humanoid bone structure, Arkk would be surprised. “Not my usual duties and I *am* rusty. Did you say two hundred? Should be doable as long as they do not all rush me at once.”

“It is scary that you sound so casual about facing down two hundred goblins.” Grabbing Vezta’s hand, this time *he* led *her* toward the library. He knew exactly which door it was, which was kind of an odd thing to know given how many times he had been there before, but he supposed it wasn’t too strange. More importantly, Vezta didn’t protest at all. She seemed quite pleased, having a chipper tone in her voice when she next spoke.

“Is it truly frightening? I imagine you would be capable of far more.”

“I don’t know what you think I am, but I’m just a regular human. Taking out a few monsters at a distance should be doable with a good bow. I could probably fight off a goblin or two in close quarters. Maybe an orc if I get lucky.”

“I feel your magic. Use that?”

“Things explode. And I don’t have time to set up ritual circles in the middle of battle.”

“Ritual circles are well and good for complicated magic, but incantations are far faster. *Electro Deus* causes explosions?”

“I have no idea what that even means.” He knew what incantations were, just not that specific one. When that spellcaster had visited the village, Arkk had questioned him at length. Incantations were advanced, however. According to that spellcaster, all sorcerers needed to start with the basic ritual magic before moving to compress extravagant rituals down into words.

“[Lightning Strike].”

Arkk flinched reflexively, but… it didn’t hurt when she said that. Now that he thought about it, the few other times she had used that language hadn’t caused pain since he woke up. And… he thought he understood. Lightning Strike.

Pausing in the hall, he looked at one of the corpses along the sides of the corridor. Holding out his hand, he said, “*Electro Deus*,” while funneling a little magic through the words.

A brilliant bolt of blue-white lightning ruptured the space between Arkk and the skeleton. It slammed into it with enough force to send the skull flying through the air, charred and blackened.

Even knowing he was in a rush, Arkk couldn’t help but stop and stare at his fingertips. They burned a little bit, but that was more of a tingle of magic waiting to be cast again than any burn from the power of the lightning.

“Do… you know any more things like that?”

“Unfortunately, no. I am not a sorcerer and cannot cast magic in such a manner. Such things are useless to me. The only other spells that come to mind are [Create Lesser Servant] and [Possession].”

Both spells blossomed in his mind. The first would create something *like* Vezta if he understood the concept correctly. There was a definite difference between [SERVANT] and servant, however. As far as he could tell, the spell created minor assistants and helpers, more akin to an apprentice in a workshop than… whatever Vezta was. Despite her calling herself a [SERVANT] using *that* language, the concept still didn’t quite click. Neither did [HEART], for that matter, or [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE]. He wasn’t sure what was different about those words compared to a full spell forming in his mind, but there it was.

The other spell, however, made him a bit queasy. “I can… completely take over someone else’s body?”

“If they are subservient to you. Won’t be much use against an opponent in combat, but… Ah, I see. Do you find it distasteful? It is quite a useful spell. My former master used it to great effect, wielding other bodies as if they were suits of armor, discarding them once they were worn down and broken. I know that spell specifically because he possessed me on occasion.”

“Discarding people?” Arkk swallowed, feeling a bit ill. “Like broken armor?”

“It kept him safe. His minions reveled in becoming possessed. It was a great honor.” Vezta frowned, looking around. “You have no minions, unfortunately. I would suggest possessing me, but you are inexperienced. You would not be able to wield me as effectively as I can wield me.”

“We’ll just… shelve that one for now.”

“I shall protect you as best I am able,” Vezta said, leaning up against Arkk. “I cannot have my new master falling so soon.” She paused, then looked up to Arkk, meeting his eyes with her burning suns. “Were we not in a hurry?”

Arkk pulled himself away, deciding to put that topic aside for… forever, probably. “Yes. Yes, we were,” he said, approaching the door to the library. It was closed, but the door swung open before he could even touch it. Assuming that was Vezta, he stepped inside without pause and headed straight for the magical circle. Much like the rest of the fortress, the torches in the library had roared to life.

“I’ll go first,” Arkk said, stepping right into the circle. When he turned around, however, he found himself alone. He looked left, then right. As if suddenly aware of where she was, he glanced downward.

Arkk stood in the center of a small puddle of dark violet slime. It wasn’t actually touching his boots. Picking up one foot and setting it down elsewhere had the slime moving out of the way, letting him step down on the stone tiles of the fortress floor. If he hadn’t been paying too much attention, he might have thought he was looking down at a strangely shaped shadow. The only problem was the glowing yellow sun staring up from that oily shadow.

“Alright then… together, I guess?”

Looking down at the circle, he was a bit disappointed that he didn’t instantly understand it the way he understood the spells Vezta had mentioned. Vezta had drawn it out, so maybe she could do that language thing for this? Something to ask later. For now, he knelt and touched it with his magic.

The peaceful and silent library vanished, replaced with the inhuman cries of alarmed monsters.

Vezta’s tendrils whipped out from his shadow, snatching a quartet of goblins. The tendrils pulled them down to the ground but didn’t stop there. Sickening snaps, squeals of pain, and rent flesh filled the air as the goblins smashed into the earth.

It did make him a little nauseous, but more at the brutal and likely painful deaths than the deaths themselves. Killing the attackers was what he had come here to do.

And the attack had started.

## 06 - The Defense of Langleey


Arkk drew back his bowstring, not bothering to aim. The second he had enough power behind the arrow, he released it. He didn’t watch where it went, assuming it would hit *something* in the mass of monsters, and instead pulled out another arrow, drew it back, and let it go as fast as he could.

It seemed as if Ilya had gotten the rest of the village to flee. There were no other humans around. The goblins and orcs were not fighting anyone, free to pillage and plunder as much as they wanted. None of the homes were smoking ruins yet, thankfully. It was more like they were searching for people than properly looting the place. Arkk wondered if the orcs had deliberately warned the goblins against wanton destruction, wanting to go through undamaged homes for plunder before setting fire to everything.

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk shouted after releasing another arrow. Blue-white lightning struck a goblin in the face.

Goblins were a diminutive species. Most barely came up to Arkk’s knees. Their skin tone ranged from light brown to a near-luminous green. With natural weapons in the form of razor claws and nasty, sharp teeth, having one anywhere nearby was liable to result in a loss of fingers, limbs, or worse. Of particular morbid interest at the moment, however, were their eyes. Disproportionately large for their heads, they were a sickly yellow color with dark black pupils.

The eyes of the goblin Arkk hit exploded into dark viscera as dark black smoke bellowed from its nostrils and ears. The goblin collapsed instantly, body wracked by seizures, never having had a chance to scream.

Feeling the tingle of magic still in his fingertips, Arkk pushed through more power, not needing the incantation again for repeated casts. A second bolt tore another goblin off the ground, flinging it into a crowd and knocking several over. A pair of goblins, touching each other, started smoking as a third bolt struck one of them. The next bolt Arkk fired off hit a sword. The goblin holding it panicked, thrashing around and striking its fellows as smoke wafted from the sword’s grip and the goblin’s hand. Arkk’s fifth bolt of lightning hit a goblin square in the chest but only made it yelp and stagger.

Arkk gasped for breath, feeling like he had just run through half the Cursed Forest again. Chest heaving, he forced himself to draw another arrow. The goblins were sprinting toward him now.

Tendrils erupted from his oversized shadow, grasping the front two goblins by the legs. Picking them up into the air, the dripping tendrils slammed the goblins back down onto more goblins, crushing bone and killing several. Arkk used the extra space to loose five arrows in rapid succession, each striking a goblin in the chest.

One goblin jumped into the air, forcing Arkk to leap to the side as it came down on him.

His shadow remained where it was. At the spot where Arkk had been standing, a gaping maw appeared in the ground. The goblin in the air saw and started to cry out, only for its cry to abruptly cut off as it vanished into a field of stars behind the teeth.

The maw snapped shut, leaving just an oily surface, interrupted only by those burning gold eyes.

Arkk turned and launched an arrow toward a screeching goblin, not having any time to ask what happened to that other one. Even if he did have the time to question Vezta, he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.

Spotting an orc coming up the dirt path toward the plaza, Arkk threw out his hand. “*Electro Deus*,” he shouted.

Much like the first goblin, the orc didn’t stand a chance. The orc flew backward, leaving an arcing trail of viscera from his eyes and mouth. Aside from some seizures on the ground when he landed, the orc didn’t move again.

Two more lightning bolts felled goblins before Arkk stopped again, exhaustion creeping up. “Vezta,” he called, nocking an arrow. “I thought you said I had a lot of magical power. Shouldn’t I be able to cast more than a handful of spells at once?”

Although Arkk hadn’t seen him fight, the spellcaster that visited the village certainly sounded as if he could cast a great many more spells during his stories.

A mouth opened in the ground not far from Arkk. “The [HEART] is constantly consuming a portion of your power. It will return that power as you claim territory and gather minions, but you should still be able to cast more than you are now. Your problem might be that you have too much power. Or, at least, you seem more able to unleash a wide breadth of power at once. Imagine it as a lake emptied by a roaring river rather than a narrow brook.” Vezta ate another goblin without even pausing her sentence. “Try moderating yourself. Be the brook, not the river.”

“I have no idea how to do that,” Arkk said as his arrow sliced through the shoulder of a goblin before hitting another straight in its open mouth. “I have never cast a spell like this before twenty minutes ago.”

“Something to practice, I suppose,” Vezta said as a tendril erupted from the ground behind Arkk just in time to swipe aside the bolt of a crossbow.

Following the trajectory of the bolt back, he spotted yet another orc. There had been a small lull in the wave of monsters attacking him for a short time there, but it looked like more and more were taking notice.

Not enough, however. He could see a black cloud of smoke rising from one of the most distant dwellings. He and Vezta might be able to handle any that came near, but there were just too many. They would have the entire village burn down before he managed to rout them.

“*Electro Deus*,” he shouted, launching a bolt at the orc before it could crank its crossbow back for a second attempt.

Rather than fire another lightning bolt at a goblin, which Vezta had started consuming with disturbing efficiency, Arkk raised his hand over his head. He had to *force* magic through his fingertips. The spell did not like *not* having a target. Yet, at a certain point, the spell couldn’t stop itself. The magic overflowed, launching a bolt skyward. This one was powerful enough to create a *deafening* crack of thunder echoing over the village as a cloud overhead violently dispersed into thin wisps that spread out over the sky.

Again, Arkk felt like he had just run a minor marathon. Although he was gasping for breath, he was quite thankful that the ringing in his ears faded quickly enough. It let him catch the tail end of something Vezta had said.

“What was that?” Arkk asked between breaths.

“I said, ‘you missed,’ in an incredulous tone of voice. Quite an impressive miss, admittedly, but not in a good way, Master.”

Arkk straightened his back, reaching for more arrows. He was starting to run out. Even if every single arrow killed a monster, he would run out long before taking out even a quarter of this army. This was every arrow John had too.

“I was trying to draw attention,” Arkk said, taking a slight moment more to aim, wanting to make the most of every arrow he had left. “Get all the monsters *here* so they aren’t wrecking the rest of the village.”

Vezta’s golden eyes turned down the long path leading from the plaza toward the rest of the village. “Well, I dare say that you succeeded,” she said. “Are you sure that was wise? I am *not* omnipotent, Master.”

Following her eyes, Arkk faltered. He had thought there were a lot of monsters between him and the church. Now, however, there was a veritable *tide* of goblins rushing up the path. Orcs, lording over them at over three times their height, shouted orders or battle cries. Several brandished large axes, swords, and pikes. A few more wielded crossbows. He only counted a dozen orcs, meaning there were still almost two dozen left if Ilya’s count had been accurate. Still, he stumbled back at the sight.

This was what he wanted. Clenching his fists, Arkk steadied himself and nocked another arrow. “Arkk,” he said.

“Sorry?”

“My name.” Arkk loosed an arrow, aimed at an orc approaching from the path up the hill. It hit the orc in the chest, but that only seemed to make him mad. The orc let out a vicious roar, raising a spike-covered cudgel. “Arkk. I don’t think I introduced myself before.”

The humanoid form of Vezta stepped out of Arkk’s peripheral vision. Her appearance made him jump slightly, but she merely offered a deep bow. “Vezta,” she said. “I look forward to serving you properly.”

“If we survive this,” Arkk mumbled. “*Electro Deus*,” he shouted, trying to focus on not pushing quite as much magic as he fired off a series of bolts at the approaching horde. He managed to fell eight goblins and a pair of orcs before feeling that exhaustion creeping up on him again.

Vezta’s tendrils were sweeping through the approaching crowd without pause now, taking out twice as many as he was. She wasn’t killing them anymore, at least not outright. There were just too many. But sweeping the front line into the horde of goblins behind probably wound up with several skewered on their comrade’s weapons. Her physical body remained near him, almost uncomfortably close, though she did not get in the way of him drawing back the bowstring.

Still, this was going to be an unsuitable position in short order.

“The church,” Arkk said. “It has strong, stone walls. The doorways and windows will limit how many monsters can approach at once.”

“No!” Vezta’s shout made him jolt, filled with a fear that she had lacked even while calling him out for drawing the attention of all the monsters with that lightning bolt.

“No?”

“Entering consecrated ground bearing the regalia of the Almighty Glory, Heart of Gold, and Holy Light is a recipe for disaster.”

“What? Why?”

“They would not take kindly to our presence.”

“*Who*?”

“I just said.” Vezta grabbed hold of Arkk’s shoulders, leaning up against him as he targeted an orc with a bolt of lightning. “I promise. I won’t fail you. If I have upset you in any way, tell me and I will correct whatever I did. Please, we can fight these monsters off without going to *them*.”

Arkk tried to shove her aside to grab at another arrow from his sack. Vezta pulled him down, just in time for him to watch a crossbow bolt sail through the air where he had been. She set him back upright, using several tendrils to support his body until he was back on his feet, then stepped aside, allowing him access to his arrows once again.

He had no idea what she was talking about. Almighty Glory? Heart of Gold? Holy Light? Only the last made any sense, with this being a Church of the Light, but Arkk had never heard it phrased that way before. None of the sermons conducted by the Abbess mentioned any of the names Vezta was worried about. The Abbess prayed to the Light for healing and protection. It was a type of magic that not everyone could make use of. Arkk had tried, once upon a time. It hadn’t blown up, but it hadn’t done anything else either.

“We’ll talk about this, later.” Arkk narrowed his eyes, focusing on an orc. “I’ll focus on the orcs. Kill as many goblins as you can… as horrifically as you can. We don’t need to kill them all. We just need to rout them.”

How many had they killed so far? Thirty? Fifty? More? Was it even that much? He honestly wasn’t sure, but he was surprised that they hadn’t routed already.

It was because there were only two of them. Even with as many deaths as there had been, the monsters saw a single human—Vezta had only emerged physically recently. With as many of them as there were, a single human didn’t stand a chance in their eyes.

If there were more of Arkk and Vezta… If the villagers had stayed…

No, they might have been killed before he returned. Fleeing was the correct choice.

But *if* there were more of them…

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk said, frying two orcs.

The orcs would be the ones to call for retreat. It was unlikely that the goblins would flee on their own. He couldn’t kill *all* of the orcs unless they were also going to kill all the goblins.

Vezta, despite her efforts, was already starting to slip. Goblins were getting closer to Arkk than they had been before now. Not quite to the point of reaching him, but with the horde pressing in on all sides…

“*Slave Natum*,” Arkk said, waving his hand. Vezta had only taught him three spells. Lightning Strike, Possession, and Create Lesser Servant.

The final of the three spells nearly made Arkk vomit. Not because of magic expenditure, although that spell had taken a lot out of him, but because of what formed on the ground in front of him.

Vezta had a certain grace to her, even with her absurd number of eyes, tentacles thrashing wildly, and maws swallowing up goblins left and right. She was elegant and poised, calm and collected. That carried through even in the movements of her unnatural extremities.

The terrible sight gave Arkk pause. A shapeless congeries of bubbling flesh, putrid slime, forming and popping eyeballs, and ugly, maw-tipped tendrils snapped into existence between him and the tide of goblins. It was small. Barely larger than a goblin.

While it used its maw-tipped tendrils to snap at a nearby goblin, it didn’t last long. The horde descended on it with vicious fervor, tearing it apart as quickly as it came. Arkk *felt* it die. The magic used in its construction came flowing back to him.

Bolstered by the brief abundance of excess magic, Arkk shouted, “*Electro Deus*,” and fired a full ten bolts of lightning.

“Sorry,” Vezta said. “Should have mentioned. Those things are useless for combat.”

“Can you make more of yourself?”

“There is only one [Self]/[Vezta].”

“Can you make it appear like there are more of you? Several bodies?”

Vezta slowly shook her head, looking casual despite tearing a goblin apart with her bare hands. “I can reform this body if it suffers damage, but it is my only body.”

“Damn,” Arkk hissed as he drew a dagger and slammed it through the forehead of a goblin that got too close. Reaching over his shoulder, he grasped three arrows. The last three. He sent them out one at a time as fast as he could, then tossed the bow aside. “*Electro Deus*!”

Not quite recovered from his recent casting, he managed four bolts before they fizzled out.

Slashing at the throat of another goblin, he bent and picked up its dropped sword. Not all the goblins had swords, most used nothing but their claws and teeth. It wasn’t a particularly good sword either, barely long enough to count as a dagger. Still, it was *something*.

Arkk swept the blades through any goblin that managed to get past Vezta. He fired off bolts of lightning whenever he felt able, but the orcs must have realized that he was targeting them. None were showing themselves. Perhaps they had decided to flee on their own, leaving the horde of goblins to cover their retreat. He wasn’t sure. He barely had time to think between strikes.

One goblin knocked into him, sending him to the ground. He stabbed it through its ear, killing it instantly, but a second goblin latched onto his arm and bit down. He cried out in pain. Vezta was already moving toward him, only to stop and crush the skull of a goblin closer to her. She turned away, attacking another goblin.

Before Arkk could even think of her actions as abandoning him, an arrow punched straight through the skull of the goblin clamped onto his arm. It continued out the other side, hitting another goblin in the chest before it could pounce on him.

Arrow after arrow rained down, striking the goblins closest to Arkk.

He craned his head to see where they were coming from.

Despite the pain in his arm, he couldn’t help but let out a joyous laugh. “Ilya!”

The elf stood atop the Baron’s manor’s roof, silver eyes gleaming in the distance. Her arm moved in a blur, launching arrows so fast it was like one steady stream of death for the goblins. She wasn’t the only one there. Five others were on the roof, including the carpenter’s young apprentice. They weren’t aiming anywhere near Arkk, however, likely not wanting to hit him on accident.

More of the villagers were down in the manor gardens, beating down any goblins that dared to approach the archers. They didn’t advance out into the tide, but Arkk couldn’t blame them for that.

Forcing himself to sit up, Arkk shouted, “*Electro Deus*!” He launched as many lightning bolts as he could, frying goblin after goblin and buying room for Vezta to continue her slaughter.

A horn sounded somewhere in the distance.

Not every goblin turned toward it. Some were too enraptured in their bloodlust. But the majority took that as the signal to fall back. They turned, scampering away from the village. Vezta made short work of the ones who failed to heed the call for retreat, leaving Arkk to flop back down onto the unusually soft ground. He laughed, panting heavily as he cradled his arm.

“We did it?”

Vezta approached, looming over him with a faint smile on her face. “It seems your goal has been accomplished.”

Arkk didn’t bother fighting the grin on his face, but it did slowly fade as he started thinking more. “For now. How many escaped? They may try again in the future.”

“Might I suggest returning to the [HEART] and—”

Vezta staggered back with the bolt of a crossbow sticking out from her chest. Black tar dripped from the end of the bolt, falling to the ground.

Arkk bolted upright. “Vezta?” he shouted, forgetting his wound as he grabbed her shoulders.

She didn’t seem all that concerned. “Rude,” she said, yanking the bolt from her chest. Her fingers, also dripping the slime that seemed to comprise her entire body, rubbed at the wound. When she pulled away, there was no sign that she had been hit at all.

Looking back to the manor, Arkk noted the villagers standing about, looking wary rather than celebratory. Only Ilya was approaching.

She did not look happy.

“I don’t suppose you can look a little more human-like?” Arkk whispered. “Just to put them a little more at ease.”

“The things I do for my Master,” Vezta said with a faux-exasperated sigh.

The shadows on the ground started drawing back toward her, leaving the ground untouched. Arkk would have expected more goblin bodies in the immediate area, but… had Vezta eaten them all? She didn’t look any larger. As the shadows vanished entirely, so too did the tendrils emerging from her dress. A pair of elegant yet heavy boots appeared in their place.

Her dark violet skin and hair didn’t change. Neither did the eyes on her person, though if they didn’t blink, perhaps they would look more like part of her dress than actual eyes. Vezta clasped her hands in front of her and took a step back, moving just behind and to the side of Arkk. Not hiding behind him, but taking up a subservient position.

Just in time for Ilya to stop in front of them.

“What—” the elf started, eyes flicking between them, then around the carnage littering the plaza. Angry as she was, she didn’t seem to know quite what to say. “Saw the lightning bolt. A few of us turned back. And now we find… what? Just *what*?”

Arkk imagined he would have said the same thing in her position. “It’s a long story,” he said, keeping his hand clamped on his arm.

Ilya’s sharp eyes didn’t miss that. Her face softened as she said, “You’re injured.”

“Goblin bite.”

Ilya grimaced. “That’s going to rot your arm off..”

Vezta took a half-step forward, still remaining behind Arkk. “If you would like, Master, I would be *pleased* to cleanse your wound.”

“*Master*,” Ilya repeated, face wrinkling in distaste. Her eyes shifted to Vezta, where they stayed for a long moment. “What have you done, Arkk? What have you done?”

Arkk raised his eyebrows. Unfortunately, he didn’t have a good answer for her.

Vezta took his silence as consent to tend to his injury. She reached out, black slime dripping from her fingers. It didn’t fix the gnarled flesh as it had with her arrow wound, but it was soothing in much the same way as the ointment the Abbess had applied earlier. The bleeding seemed to stop as well.

Offering her a small smile, he looked back to Ilya. Answering her question, he said, “I saved the village?”

Ilya stared for a long moment before letting out a clipped laugh. It didn’t sound like a particularly happy laugh, but Arkk would take it over her angry face any day. “If only that were all,” she mumbled, glancing back to the Baron’s manor. “We need to make sure there aren’t any stragglers,” she said, louder. “Keep your monster on a leash and don’t go anywhere. We need to talk.”

“It’s never good when a girl says that.”

“Like you have any experience.” She turned away, but paused and looked back, momentary smile gone. “I’m serious. You’ve…” Her eyes flicked to Vezta. “Don’t go anywhere.”

With that, she stalked off.

Arkk slumped. There wasn’t any pain in his arm, thanks to Vezta, but it didn’t look good. And he was so tired. Exhausted from fighting and casting spells. His sleep, lucky though he was to have had it at all, hadn’t been the best. And he had been running all last evening. He wanted nothing more than to just lean back and close his eyes.

“Are you alright? That bolt…” Arkk mumbled, closing his eyes while standing. “If you hadn’t been able to heal like that.”

“I was skewered by numerous goblin swords as well. I do not claim to be invulnerable but it will take more than that to down me.”

“Still…”

“Rest now. Know that I shall protect you to the best of my ability.”

“Don’t hurt the villagers.”

“I am a [SERVANT]. I exist to assist you in your desires. If you do not desire harm to the villagers, they have nothing to fear from me.”

“Thank you, Vezta,” Arkk said, leaning against her. “You saved my village.”

“Your desire saved it.”

“No, I’m serious. *Thank you*.” Arkk opened his eyes, meeting her black and gold eyes. “If there is anything I can do…”

Vezta pressed her lips together, then nodded slowly. “Become a master truly worthy of my services. That is all I ask.”

“I’ll do my best.”

## 07 - Discussions and Promises


“No amount of glaring is going to bring my mood down today!” Arkk said with a laugh, raising his flagon with the crowd.

Once it became clear that Vezta was not a danger to the people of the village, suspicion turned to relief and relief turned to joy. Langleey Village would not fall to the wolves—or goblins—and the people would not have to beg the Duke for mercy. After clearing out the goblins who missed the memo that it was time to leave, everyone returned to the plaza. It was a bit of a grisly job, clearing the place out, but Vezta was more than happy to handle that task.

Keeping things tidy was one of her primary duties. Not combat.

Who would have thought?

The Baron raised his flagon, a wide grin on his face. “And right you are for that. Smile, Ilya! I didn’t break out the kegs of good mead so you could sit about unhappy!”

Before today, Arkk hadn’t known there was good mead. Just the watered-down beer that Ken brewed. The next celebration the village had, he would be reminding the Baron about the honeyed mead.

Of course, this afternoon wasn’t all about celebrating. It was as much to calm down the villagers as it was a toast to the routing of the horde. Two homes had gone up in flames, leaving little more than charcoal behind. A few other buildings suffered at the hands of goblins and were now trashed beyond reasonable habitation. Not that anyone would want to go back to their homes tonight.

For the next week at the very least, the village would split between the Baron’s manor, the church, and the main storehouse. All right up here around the plaza. Watchmen would set posts around the clock and nobody was to go anywhere on their own. While nobody really believed that the goblins and orcs would return after running from a thrashing delivered by just two people—plus the villagers toward the end—they couldn’t say for sure. Especially if some goblins got loose and decided to come back on their own.

“—jumped right on my back! The biggest orc you ever saw. Instinct took over and I threw myself into the wall. That stunned it enough to get it off me. I turned and started pounding its face in,” Hurtt said, miming punch after punch. “Thought I had it down to rights until its buddy showed up. An even bigger orc!” The small crowd he was telling his tall tale to gasped.

Arkk was fairly certain that his lightning had frightened off all the orcs well before Hurtt showed up. Once they realized that he was picking them out with his bolts of lightning, they vanished. He had probably only killed ten. Maybe not even that many.

John, sitting nearby, met Arkk’s gaze. He simply rolled his eyes and shook his head.

Not everyone was in quite as high of spirits. Those whose homes were damaged or destroyed went about with bitter-sweet expressions on their faces. While the village would help them recover, it still stung to lose what they had. Aside from them, Abbess Keena, though at a table nearby, hadn’t spoken to Arkk since returning. She wouldn’t even look at him. He did catch her sneaking glances—often with a heavy scowl in place—at Vezta.

Most people seemed a bit nervous about Vezta’s presence. More so those who had arrived in time to see the fight. Only Ilya, Baron Gert and his wife, John, and Hale seemed willing to approach. And Jorgen and Hurtt, neither of whom would ever admit to being afraid of anything.

It probably didn’t help that Vezta wasn’t exactly joining in on the festivities. She stood still and silent just behind Arkk, hands clasped together with a faint smile never leaving her face.

“What do goblins taste like?”

Arkk raised his eyebrows, ears catching a strange question right behind him. Turning around, he found Hale *more* than willing to approach Vezta. The young carpenter’s apprentice stood right at Vezta’s side, staring up at her. Vezta didn’t look like she noticed or cared, at least not until Arkk turned around. Only then did she look down at Hale, tilting her head to the side in the process.

“I saw teeth in the ground around you and Arkk,” Hale said. “One of the goblins fell into the open mouth and it snapped shut.”

The surrounding conversations slowly died off, Hale having spoken loud and clear. Even Jorgen and Hurtt paused their exaggerated tales to subtly glance in the direction of the mysterious monster.

“Humans consume boars, correct?” Vezta asked slowly. “Fat, juicy pigs?”

Hale nodded her head, sending her dark twin tails bobbing.

“Goblins are like the opposite of that. Stringy, scrawny, and more crunch than flesh.”

A few disquieted murmurs rippled through the villagers. Not that Vezta’s answer perturbed Hale in the slightest. She nodded her head as if that was what she expected and looked back up. “What about orcs?”

“I cannot say I have ever eaten an orc. None strayed close enough today and I do not recall such a creature existing the last time I walked the surface.”

Hale frowned but asked another question, undaunted. “Have you ever eaten a huma—”

“Alright!” John said, standing and grabbing Hale’s shoulders in one swift move. He started dragging her off toward the garden around the Baron’s manor. “Let’s go have a talk.”

An uncomfortable silence followed in their wake. A whole lot more people were probably wondering about Hale’s question, Arkk included. Unlike Hale, few others would have her apparently innocent curiosity over the matter.

“Orcs didn’t exist?” Arkk asked, trying to get the morbid question out of people’s minds. “How long ago was that?”

“I cannot say I counted the nights. I apologize.”

“No, no. Don’t worry. I just hadn’t ever heard of orcs not existing.”

The Baron, emboldened by the question and answer session, or just by Vezta breaking her silence, leaned forward somewhat. “We’ve had the occasional beastman and demihuman pass through the village, but I’ve never seen something quite like you. What manner of creature are you, if you don’t mind my asking?” he added hurriedly.

“I am the [SERVANT] of the [HEART].”

Everyone within earshot flinched except for Arkk. He shot a glance backward. “None of that,” he said.

Vezta dipped her head in an apologetic bow. “There is no better concept for describing myself, but I shall refrain from using… that language unexpectedly in the future.”

“Servant, the regular word, will have to work.”

“Understood. If that is what you wish,” Vezta said.

Ilya slammed her hands into the table as she stood up. “Arkk. You avoided me all day. We need to talk. *Now*.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, glancing around. Between Hale’s questions, the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE], and now Ilya slamming her hands down, the good mood of the celebration had completely vanished. His mood included. With a small sigh, he set down his flagon of mead. Ilya turned and stalked off a short distance down the path leading to the rest of the village.

“I’ll be back,” he said, both to Vezta as well as the Baron. He stepped aside, only to pause and shoot a pained smile at Gert. “Unless she realizes I left her bow back at the western edge of the Cursed Forest.”

That got a foggy chuckle from the rotund man.

Vezta, Arkk noted, did not follow after him. He was a bit surprised. Although he was going to tell her to wait—Ilya clearly wanted to speak privately—he still expected her to trail along until he told her not to. Unless she had known that he was going to tell her to wait… Which was possible.

There was something there. Something between them. Arkk couldn’t quite put his finger on it. During the fight, there had been a few times where he had known what she was doing without him actually seeing her do it. The moment when she had swiped one of the crossbow bolts out of the air stuck out vividly. Then there was when she had hidden in his shadow before using the magic circle to arrive. He had simply *known* where she would be.

They were connected together. Somehow.

It was a bit eerie but after that fight? Arkk found it hard to care that much. She had protected him and saved the village. He knew beforehand that there was some kind of binding in that contract, he just hadn’t known exactly what form it would take.

Shoving the thoughts aside, Arkk had to pick up the pace to catch up with Ilya’s long strides. Elf that she was, Ilya was a full head taller than he was. Her irritation put an extra bout of haste in each step, making her even faster.

They were well beyond the hearing range of anyone up at the plaza. Ilya showed no sign of slowing. She continued marching with purpose all the way down the small hill and to the carpentry shop. “Is your monster going to attack anyone?” she said, spinning on her heel as soon as they were around the side of the building.

Taken aback, Arkk shook his head. “No? She said she wouldn’t.”

“And you believe it?”

“I mean… yes? Why save the village only to turn around and attack it moments later? If she wanted to hurt people, she could have simply refused to help.” Arkk frowned. “And you believe that too, or you wouldn’t have left her alone back there.”

Ilya crossed her arms. Outside the direct presence of Vezta, she didn’t look quite so upset. Still, she pressed her lips into a thin line as she stared at Arkk. Turning away, she pointed to the magic circle that was still burned into the ground. “Take me there,” she said.

“Take you?”

“Hale told me. You disappeared into this circle saying you were going to get help and not to worry because it wasn’t a demon.”

“It’s not—She’s not. I asked the Abbess. Also, I asked Vezta. She seemed offended that I would even think that.”

“I’m worried it is worse than a demon.” Crossing her arms again, Ilya tapped her finger on her elbow.

“Worse? What could possibly—”

“Can you take me there or not?”

Clamping his mouth shut, Arkk looked down at the circle burned into the dirt. It looked intact despite the battle. There were a few stains on the ground around it. Dark blotches marring the dirt and grass from where Vezta had killed a few goblins upon their arrival. Nothing looked to have touched the circle itself.

“Yeah,” Arkk said. “I think so.”

Ilya stepped forward until she reached the center of the circle. Turning around, she shot Arkk a look.

Arkk wasn’t *exactly* sure how to send other people. Although he had used the circle three times and nothing bad happened any of those times, he hoped it was safe for other people to use. Reaching down, standing on the outside of the circle, he pushed just a little magic into it. The pattern in the ground flashed and Ilya disappeared.

Immediately, he felt warning bells go off in his head. Not in the sense that he might *feel* something was amiss, but literal warning bells. As clear as the church bells he had rung to warn the villagers. Focusing on the sensation made Arkk gasp.

He could see Ilya. She stood in the fortress library, looking around with narrowed eyes. He was still in the village, not moving, not sure what might happen if he appeared in the same spot she currently occupied. Yet, he could see her. A strange case of double-vision settled over his mind. She didn’t move save to draw her daggers, clearly checking around herself for danger. She even checked upward, though if she noted Arkk watching from above, she didn’t show it.

Slowly, she moved forward, reaching out for a book on a nearby shelf. The spine crumbled under her lithe fingers. Not promising for Arkk’s hope of finding magic in that library. As soon as she stepped out of the circle, approaching the crystal ball, Arkk moved in. With a push of magic, Arkk was inside the library alongside Ilya.

She jumped, grip tightening around her dagger, but she didn’t strike at him.

“This place is old,” she said softly. “The Cursed Forest was the Cursed Forest when my mother was a young girl. If people ever lived here, it probably wasn’t the Cursed Forest back then.”

“I thought it was some pre-Calamity fortress. Mostly because of Vezta.”

“She told you so?”

“No, but just look at her. Never heard of a beastman, demihuman, or *anything* that resembles her, right? More like the monsters of old.”

Ilya drew in a resigned breath through her teeth. “So you knew that much and *still* decided to go along with what she wanted?”

“I don’t think that makes her worse than a demon. Does it? She’s just old. Like a dragon or… Where are you going?”

Ilya moved with purpose, exiting the library. Arkk did note that the door did not simply swing open for her until he approached from behind. If she was curious about it opening on its own, she didn’t say. Instead, she looked up and down the corridor before selecting the right path.

The direction that led toward the [HEART].

Ilya stopped partway, kneeling near one of the skeletal corpses. Prying a shield from where it had seemingly *fused* with the floor, she stared down at the remains of the heraldry on the corroded surface. It was a bit hard to make out, but it was some kind of great tree. Something surrounded the tree—people, perhaps?—but it was mostly a scarring of rust. It certainly wasn’t the emblems used in the Duchy of Mystakeen.

An unsettling noise echoed down the corridor. A slopping, squishing noise. Ilya was on her feet, daggers at the ready. Arkk started as well, though quickly calmed down. Much like simply knowing where Vezta was or seeing Ilya in the library, he knew and saw what was ahead of them.

“It’s a lesser servant,” Arkk said, grimacing as he watched its pulsating mass of boiling flesh squirm down the corridor.

It turned the corner of a room up ahead. The doors, Arkk noted, opened for it all on their own. It paid them little mind, choosing to stop at a corpse instead. A thick tentacle stretched out, mouth forming as it moved. Its mouth, a ring of razor-sharp needles, scooped up the skeleton, armor, and all, ripping it to shreds as it ate.

“Vile,” Ilya hissed.

Arkk… didn’t disagree. Perhaps because he had seen one before, he didn’t find it that shocking, but it wasn’t a pleasant creature to look at. Of greater interest was the fact that it was *his*. Not the same one he had summoned back during the fight—that one had been killed in seconds—but it was still connected to him. Just like Vezta was.

After consuming the corpse, it started doing *something*. A hideous dance of gyrating tendrils. There was magic in the air, twisting and following its movements. Slowly, the cracked and worn stone wall it stood near changed. Bricks that must have been down here for ages, wearing down under wind, water, and time, reformed. Cracks sealed together, bricks grew into the places left behind by missing bits, and the entire section of the wall smoothed over, looking as if the masons who built it had just finished.

“My mother warned me of this,” Ilya said.

“Of tentacle monsters with aspirations to be stone masons?” Arkk asked, watching as the lesser servant moved to the opposite wall to repeat its dance.

Ilya looked back, shooting him a *look*. “Of a great evil ready to rise once again. Monsters that once brought the world to its knees, nearly destroying everything.”

“I know it looks gross, but great evil? Those monsters just saved our village,” Arkk said, feeling defensive. Though he paused and thought. “Besides *that* thing is building, not destroying anything.”

The lesser servant finished with the wall and started on the floor. It cleared away bits of debris and a discarded sword, consuming them as it had the corpse earlier. Maybe that counted as destroying? But it was more just cleaning up, which became even more evident when the dark grey stone repaired itself just as the wall had, gaining a pattern like a compass rose with a deep blue-violet gemstone placed in the very center.

“I only know what my mother told me, which wasn’t much,” Ilya said, edging past the lesser servant. It didn’t seem to notice or care about their presence, carrying on cleaning the corridor. “I don’t know that she knows the full story. My mother is only a little older than six hundred. Much younger than this place if it truly is pre-Calamity.”

“And what story is that?” Arkk asked, only partially paying attention. He was more focused on the creature. His first thought was that Vezta had come back and created it because he was fairly certain that this place had been otherwise deserted, but she had been at his side ever since he activated that artifact.

Not to mention, it was connected to him. Not to Vezta.

“My mother, and her mother before her, lived here in this village specifically to keep watch on the Cursed Forest. The elvish village they came from believed a great evil resided here. An evil that would one day return.”

“Vezta helped save the village,” Arkk said again.

“I know. I do not know if that creature is the evil that my mother spoke of.” She paused, frowning. “It certainly didn’t feel like it back in the village. Though I can’t say it acted kind… the way it looked at Hale…”

“As far as I can tell, Vezta listens to me. *I* am not evil.”

Ilya looked back, flashing a grin. “No. Just stupid. Running through the Cursed Forest?”

“It worked, didn’t it? I got back before you *and* brought help. I wasn’t even poisoning the ground with every step. I checked.” Arkk stamped his feet on the ground as if demonstrating. “Walked right over some patches of grass and none of it withered and died.”

“Nevertheless,” Ilya started, smile fading. “The Cursed Forest is dead and has remained dead since my grandmother’s time. That doesn’t happen naturally. *Something* in this forest is causing problems.”

They stopped at the heavy iron doors that led into the room with the sphere and pit. Much like the hallway that the servant had been working on, something had refurbished this door. All evidence of wear, corrosion, and battle damage had gone. The surface practically gleamed. At Arkk’s approach, it swung open without a single creaking noise.

There were no bodies inside the chamber. Not even that odd cube with its strange limbs. The lesser servant must have cleaned the place out. The walls and floor had been repaired. Even that giant divot where the stone sphere had sat was now level with the rest of the floor.

Ilya didn’t follow him inside. She stood just outside, looking in. A wince crossed her features with every beat of the stone [HEART].

“What’s wrong?”

“I don’t… It feels wrong. You are at least capable of sensing magic, right? Surely you feel that in the air?”

Arkk looked at the beating heart. It thumped in time with his own heart. There was, he noted, a taste of magic in the air. It didn’t feel unpleasant or wrong. The more he focused, the more it felt like his own magic, if on a much grander scale. “Vezta said something about my magic being tied up in the heart.” Each beat spread out a faint wave of magic over the room. If he were being honest, it felt comfortable. Like he belonged here. “That is probably what you’re feeling.”

Ilya closed her eyes, rubbing her forehead. “I’m no spellcaster. I don’t know what I’m feeling. I just don’t like it. Can’t we just walk away? Pretend you never found this place or that monster?”

“I made a promise,” Arkk said with a shake of his head. “Vezta helped save the village. I’ll help her out in turn. She seems…” He trailed off, thinking for a moment. “Lonely. Maybe. I would be the evil one if I just abandoned her.”

“Then promise *me*,” Ilya said, stepping into the room. She grabbed hold of his hands and held them up to her chest. “Promise me you won’t lose yourself.”

“Lose myself? Ilya, what do you think—”

“*Promise me*,” she said, far more insistent. “I’ll help. I’ll keep you centered. But I need you to promise that you will try too.”

Arkk swallowed, staring into her silver eyes. Ilya normally had the air of a tease about her, offering snide remarks and casually exclaiming false despair over his actions; the look on her face when magic he tried to do went wrong… But now, she was serious. Deadly serious.

Finding himself nodding, Arkk said. “Alright. I won’t lose myself. You can help me all you want, but it’s completely unnecessary.”

Ilya closed her eyes, letting out a long sigh of relief. Like he would have rejected her.

Just as Arkk was about to comment on the absurdity of that, he felt something. A slight change. A tether formed, stretching between Ilya and himself, relayed off the [HEART]. It was a lot like the bond he had noticed with that lesser servant or with Vezta, but not quite the same. They were directly connected to him. Ilya, with the [HEART] between them, was a step removed.

“Ilya?”

Silver eyes snapped open. “What?”

“Did you… feel that?”

Her brow furrowed. “Feel what?”

“I… don’t know. Something just happened between us.”

Ilya looked down between them, noticed her hands holding Arkk’s close to her chest, and promptly gave him a light shove. She shot him a heavy scowl and turned away. “I felt thanks for you. Nothing more happened between us, Arkk.”

“No, not—”

“I’ve told you, I’m much too young for you.”

“It’s not… You’re ten years older than me!”

“I’m only interested in other elves.”

“You’ve never seen any other elves besides your mother.”

Ilya started stalking away, shaking her head. “Come on, you love-struck fool. Now is hardly the time for this.”

Arkk caught her hand before she could walk more than three steps. “I’m serious, Ilya. Something magical happened between us and I do not mean that in a romantic sense. We’re… bound together, somehow.”

“Bound together?” Ilya raised an eyebrow. She locked eyes with him for a long moment, but slowly widened her eyes and looked over his shoulder. “Oh. I’m not sure what you are talking about…” Trailing off, she took a deep breath. “But the air here doesn’t feel quite so bad.”

“Is that good?”

“I assume so? But we should leave regardless. I don’t like leaving your monster alone with the villagers.”

“Yeah… I think I need to talk to Vezta and figure out exactly what is going on here.”

Thinking about Vezta, he found he could still see her. She stood in the middle of the village, hardly paying attention to anyone, though no one looked interested in interacting with her either. The little party seemed to be at a close anyway. Taking a moment, Arkk inspected the link between them, trying to figure it out a little more. He had assumed that it formed because he made that contract with Vezta, but now, with Ilya having a similar link, he wasn’t so sure. While inspecting it, he found he could *tug* on the link, for lack of a better word.

Ripped through time and space, Vezta appeared in front of Arkk. She was clearly off balance, but a part of her dress peeled away into a thick tendril, catching her. As soon as she got her balance back, the tendril merged seamlessly into her dress once again.

While Ilya drew her daggers in a flash, wary, Vezta simply turned with her faint smile firmly in place. She didn’t look the least bit irritated at suddenly finding herself somewhere new. Her golden eyes locked onto Arkk, dipped down to where his hand held Ilya’s hand, then moved up to Ilya’s face.

“Ah, your first minion. A wise choice. Her sharp elven eyes and keen accuracy with a bow offer great value in many situations.”

“My *what*?”

“*Minion*?” Ilya hissed, shifting a glare from Vezta to Arkk.

“I’m sorry,” Vezta said, canting her head. “Was there a mistranslation? [Initial]/[ready-set-go]|[minion]/[underling]/[employee].”

Arkk understood those concepts forced into his mind. He had *hired* Ilya. Their promise constituted an agreement for her to effectively work for him. It wasn’t binding. He could fire her or she could choose to leave. But for the moment, she was his minion. “Employee,” Arkk said, “is a better word. Use that.”

“As you wish.”

“Now, what is this link between us? And you and me. And me and…” Arkk trailed off, finding the lesser servant that was roaming the corridors of the fortress. With a yank on the link, he picked it up and dropped it down next to them. “Where did this even come from?”

Ilya jumped back with a sharp gasp, but Vezta just smiled down at the creature.

“A bond between a lord and his subjects runs much deeper via the [HEART]. We can call to you in times of crisis, drawing your attention. You are aware of where any of us are at any given time. The bond prevents direct harm caused by employees, though they can break the bond and then attack, you will at least be alerted. And, as you so expertly demonstrated, you can move us anywhere within your territory at will.”

Vezta knelt, smiling to herself as she patted the lesser servant on its… Arkk didn’t think they had heads or backs or anything resembling humanoid bodily structure. “As for this, now that the [HEART] is functioning once more, it will tend to the most basic of chores using these servants. A few will spawn on their own, but you can create more using the spell I taught you. You should be able to direct them if you wish. They are miserable fighters, but quite capable diggers and builders.”

“What is it?” Ilya said. “Not the… *thing*, but the HEART.” She tried to use the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE], but it just didn’t quite have the same effect as when Vezta did.

“[HEART]|[ultimate]|[defensive tool]/[offensive tool].”

Ilya didn’t look like the language bothered her all that much. She had flinched earlier, back when Vezta had identified herself to the villagers, but now, she barely blinked. “What is its purpose? Who built it and why?”

“Ah. It was a gift from the [PANTHEON] to my former master for the express purpose of using it as he desired. Through it, he acquired vast wealth, power, and followers. He would have been the ruler of this land were it not for the interference of the Heart of Gold, the Almighty Glory, and the Holy Light. They severed this world’s connection to the [UNDERWORLD], cutting off a majority of his employees and power. He sent me to uncover what they had done and how to reverse it. Alas, when I returned, my master was gone and the fortress was in ruins.”

Ilya and Arkk glanced at each other. He could see in her eyes that she understood about as much as he did. Which was to say not much at all. The three names Vezta mentioned were gods, she had said so before, but [PANTHEON] sounded like one or multiple gods as well. [UNDERWORLD] was a place. Maybe Vezta’s home? Somewhere not connected to the world.

“What was your former master’s name?” Ilya asked. “If he ruled the land, maybe we’ve heard of him.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow. He had no idea how Ilya would know that. Duke Levi Woldair was the only name he could think of off the top of his head, and only because he was *their* duke. He supposed he could name King Abe Lafoar for the same reason. Their predecessors? He didn’t have a clue. Kings and dukes just didn’t matter much in their little village.

“Keeper of the [HEART], Razerk.”

Just as Arkk expected, the name meant nothing to him. From the corner of his eye, he saw Ilya slowly shaking her head as well.

“I wish my mother were here,” she said softly.

“She didn’t leave books behind? A journal, maybe?”

“No. Just the vague stories about keeping a watch on the Cursed Forest. She didn’t even say what to *do* about it. Just to watch.”

That got Arkk wondering. “Vezta, is the [HEART] responsible for the… deadness in the land around it?”

“Yes.” Ignoring the way Ilya tensed, Vezta continued, “The [HEART] is partially alive, but it requires magic as sustenance. Broken and without a master, the [HEART] sought alternative sources of nourishment, draining the life from the forest above.”

“So… it’s fixed then? The forest will recover?”

“I wouldn’t count on immediate change,” Vezta said slowly. “But so long as your magic continues to flow, the [HEART] should have no need of such methods.”

“Well, that’s great then,” Arkk said with a widening smile.

Ilya didn’t mirror his grin, staring at Vezta with cold eyes. “Is this thing going to kill Arkk?”

Arkk sucked in a breath, snapping his gaze to Vezta.

“No. Even if something were to block his magic from recovering, it would return to the forest over killing its master.”

Letting out a small sigh, Arkk put his grin on once again. “Wonderful. See? We’ve *fixed* things, not broken them.”

Ilya allowed herself a small shadow of his smile but started rubbing her forehead. “I think I need to sleep on this. Organize my thoughts.”

“We can have the little one prepare quarters for the employees—”

“I need to sleep in my *own* bed,” Ilya said, interrupting Vezta. She turned to Arkk, then started walking down the corridor. “Take me back.”

“Right. Right,” Arkk said, following after her. “But I might stay here for a while. Quiz Vezta on what else this thing can do. *How* it functions as a defensive tool and stuff like that. It would be handy if the goblins come back.”

“Fine. Just… remember our promise.”

“I will.”

## 08 - Plots and Plans


“This library is useless,” Ilya said, tossing a book into the trash pile. A pile that was growing much faster than the *keep* pile.

Fortress Al-Mir’s library might have been an impressive collection of tomes and knowledge at one point in time, but that time had long since passed. If only time had been eating away at this room, there might have been some worth salvaging. Unfortunately, much like many other rooms in the fortress, there was a fissure in the ceiling. This one wasn’t as large as the one Arkk had fallen into, but water could get in easily.

Very few books were in any kind of state to be touched, let alone read. Assuming mold hadn’t eaten the book, it still probably couldn’t be opened. Those that could be opened without destroying the entire thing were, more often than not, lacking any text on their pages. The words had been washed away or the ink had simply decayed over the ages.

Arkk had a small pile next to him. A dozen full books and a handful of scattered pages. Vezta, sitting at a desk next to him, was doing her best to clean them of their filth without further damaging them.

But even those were more or less useless.

“I just don’t understand how *you* can’t read them,” Arkk said, frowning as he copied legible symbols from one book that was too damaged to believe it would be around for much longer. The Baron had graciously provided a few rolls of vellum.

Even with the small stack of books here, nobody present could read the words. The particular page he was working on had a crude depiction of eight women bathing in a green pool. At least, that was what he *thought* it was. In truth, it could be anything. The book was filled with plants and animals that he had never seen before—or that he couldn’t recognize from the faded and, frankly, amateurish drawings.

“Aren’t these from the time of your former master?”

Vezta’s hands did not slow as she looked up to Arkk, continuing to copy the text as she spoke. “In truth, I only know the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE]. The [HEART] is what allows me to communicate with you and all who speak your language. It was the same with my former master. With his passing, I no longer have access to his knowledge of languages. The text present in these tomes is as unfamiliar to me as it is to you.”

“This is a waste of time,” Ilya grumbled, tossing aside yet another book. “We should be back out hunting. Especially now, with the damage the farms sustained.”

Arkk sighed. This wasn’t the first time they had gone through this argument in the last five days.

At first, Ilya was all for uncovering more about the history of Fortress Al-Mir. Unfortunately, aside from Vezta, who Ilya didn’t exactly trust, there were no real sources of information. Langleey Village didn’t have a library or any historians. The closest thing was the Baron’s sitting room, which had a handful of historical books. However, none were historical *enough*. None mentioned anything pre-Calamity. One of his books listed old rulers and kings, but there had been no mention of Razerk, Vezta’s former master.

They hadn’t *only* been reading old tomes. There was work to be done. Ilya and Arkk had gone out to recover her bow and the horses left from their hunting trip, using a teleportation ritual handily provided by Vezta to cut the time spent into a small fraction of what it otherwise would have taken.

Vezta had been quite pleased to put her skills to use in rebuilding the burned-out homes. She could lift an entire wall on her own, hammering fasteners into place at the same time with her plethora of tendrils. Of course, that had spooked the villagers a bit at first, but Arkk thought they got over it. Having proper homes back in mere days instead of weeks was worth it.

“Arkk,” Ilya said, voice stiff. “One of your *things* is back.”

Looking up from the manuscripts, Arkk scowled. One of the four lesser servants crawled through the door and started *eating* the pile of trash books, the emptied shelves, and even parts of the floor and walls. Its mouths had some kind of magic to them, allowing them to bite right through solid stone and earth. He had seen them eating the debris in caved-in corridors as if the stone was little more than bread.

“It isn’t going to touch anything we’re still using,” Arkk said with confidence. “Just ignore it.”

“Vezta is bad enough. If anyone else saw these things…”

“They’re the same species as you, right? Can’t they… look like you do?”

“They are nowhere near me,” Vezta said, slight offense in her tone. “They are, however, protoplasmic beings, able to assume any form their duties require of them.”

“So if their duties require them to look normal—”

“Normal is subjective, Master.” Vezta sighed. “But I understand your desires. I suppose I can teach them some tricks of aesthetics. Would you prefer that task to take priority over the books?”

“No,” Arkk said. “Better finish copying and cleaning the books before they deteriorate any further.”

“Where does everything they eat even *go*?” Ilya asked, staring at the monster with grotesque fascination as its gaping maw *inhaled* a rotted and worn desk three times its size. “I’ve seen these things eat entire rooms filled with broken beds, bodies, equipment, and tools. They aren’t that big.”

“Beings of the [HEART] return material for transmutation.”

“Transmutation?” Arkk asked.

“Are you unfamiliar with transmutation tablets, Master?”

“Arkk.”

“Have you not checked the [HEART] chamber in recent days, Arkk?”

“I’ve been busy,” Arkk said, dipping his pen back into the vial of ink. “Still busy,” he said.

Ilya stood, dusting off her leather pants. “I’ll check it. Anything to get away from this room for a bit. I think I’ve got mold growing in my hair…”

Arkk waved her off. They were pretty much done with the library anyway. There was only one shelf left to sort through and it was the most damaged shelf in the entire room, positioned directly under the fissure. He wasn’t expecting anything from it. Letting the servant eat it now would probably save a lot of time.

“Master,” Vezta said after a few minutes.

“Arkk, please.”

“I… It is the height of impropriety to bring up my former master unbidden,” Vezta said, setting down her pen for the first time since they started.

Recognizing that she had something important to ask, he finished copying the line he was on and lowered his pen as well. “It’s fine. I don’t mind.”

“Razerk left me with one final mission. One I have been unable to accomplish. My failure has been weighing on me for centuries now… and I…”

“You want to finish it?” Arkk closed his eyes, thinking back to their conversation nearly a week ago now. “Undoing whatever the… gods did to weaken your former master?”

“It would be beneficial to you as well, Master,” Vezta said, speaking faster as if afraid he would reject her. “Breaking the seal on the world would allow the [HEART] to access the [PANTHEON]’s power. You would be able to gain their blessings. We would be able to reopen the portal to begin hiring employees beyond those humans with whom you are acquainted. And… I would be free to dedicate myself wholeheartedly toward your goals without the shadow of failure weighing on my shoulders.”

“What *exactly* would we be doing if we undo this? I don’t know much of anything about… gods. The Abbess prays to the Light and receives blessings of healing to distribute in return. Beyond that, the Light is supposed to be the source of all life, growing the plants, blessing births, protecting—”

“*Lies*,” Vezta hissed. “Protection? Life? The gods, the Heart of Gold, Holy Light, and Almighty Glory are beings of death and destruction. They…” Vezta paused, pressing her lips together. “I do not know the full history of the world,” she said eventually. “I am not exactly certain about what my former master wished of me. Initially, he sent me out to discover what had happened to the portal—perhaps you saw the room with the crystal archway?”

“I did, yes,” Arkk said, thinking back to his initial tour of the fortress. Thinking about it, he could *see* it just as he could see any other location within the fortress. A large room with a high ceiling, dominated by a pale crystal structure as large as a small home. Shaking his head, Arkk refocused on Vezta, barely noting the red light fading around them. “What of it?”

“That is a portal that leads to the [UNDERWORLD]. A realm once connected to this world, now severed. My former master recruited heavily from the magical inhabitants there to form his armies.”

“Magical inhabitants?”

“Most magical beings are not native to this world,” Vezta said, sounding an awful lot like Abbess Keena when lecturing. “The [UNDERWORLD] is one of many elsewheres such creatures originate from.”

“I… see…”

“Think of it as another continent except on a far grander scale with travelers hailing from afar.”

“Huh.

“In any case, I set out to uncover why the portal stopped functioning. I believe I have a solution, although I don’t know exactly what needs to be done as I planned on relying on my former master’s vast knowledge of ritual magic to finalize the plans. *However*, I have determined in the years since that the portal is merely a small symptom of a much greater illness in this world.

“From the context of what you and Ilya have spoken of, I believe my former master wished for me to undo what you refer to as the Calamity.”

Arkk blinked several times, eyes widening. “You want to undo the Calamity?”

The Calamity, to Arkk, was little more than a myth. It was something that had happened so long ago that it was entirely irrelevant to him. But he knew the stories. The sky darkened for years. Life withered. Magic weakened. Entire races perished. Monsters of old, creatures beyond mere beastmen or demihumans, had vanished. Only the dragons had survived, and everyone knew they were a dying race, unable to procreate. Every dragon that died was one dragon permanently removed from the world, never to be replaced.

“Is that even possible?”

“The effects of the Calamity have already rippled through the world. Those who died would not magically return to life. But we can restore the proper order of the world, how it was meant to be before your so-called *Light* interfered.”

“But is it *possible*? I don’t… I don’t want to disappoint you, Vezta, but I’m not some great magi of old or even a proper spellcaster. I’m a farmer. A hunter. I’m not even very good at the latter job.”

Vezta shook her head. “It would be a task far beyond any mortal.”

“Then—”

“But you are no mere mortal, Master. You have claimed the [HEART] of Fortress Al-Mir. It is not fully functional *yet* but it is still a magical artifact unrivaled by anything else in existence. If it can be restored, such a task may just be within our grasp. In addition, there are other [HEART]s out there. They were relatively common in my former master’s time. Lay claim to those and reversing the calamity would be a matter most trivial.

“The first step, I believe, should still be to restore functionality to the portal. I know *roughly* how to fix that. If you were to recruit a capable spellcaster or delve into such studies yourself, I believe we could accomplish that task in short order.”

Arkk stared at the woman before him, wondering if there wasn’t something to Ilya’s fear of this place. The way Vezta spoke, the fervor in her voice, that utter belief that the [HEART], and Arkk by extension, was capable of *undoing* the *Calamity*. The legends he knew spoke of the Calamity like it was a force of nature. Not something that anyone had been able to fight, whether they be human, dragon, or…

Apparently not gods, if Vezta’s claims that the Light had *caused* the Calamity were true.

“This Underworld place is your home?” Arkk said, mostly trying to fill the silent gap with *some* sound so that he wasn’t left dwelling on his thoughts. “Or where you came from?”

Vezta shook her head, then looked upward toward the recently repaired arching ceiling. “I am a being of the [STARS].”

“Ah.” Arkk’s eyes flicked to one of the golden sun-like eyes set into the cuff on her wrist. “Makes sense, I guess. Still, repairing the Calamity? That sounds so grandiose for someone like…” Trailing off, Arkk shook his head. He straightened his back and locked eyes with Vezta. “No. I made a promise to be someone you can look up to. If you say I can do it, then I’ll do my best.”

Vezta stood, kneeled, then bowed until her forehead touched the ground. “Thank you, Master. I feel as if this weight I have been carrying is lessened already. I will not fail you.”

“You… don’t need to do that. *Please* don’t do that. If Ilya saw you like that, she would think *I* am forcing you—”

A voice from behind Arkk made him shudder. “You mean you *aren’t* a depraved, love-deprived fool abusing your servant?”

Turning slowly in his seat, Arkk winced under Ilya’s silver eyes. “I’m not… She’s not… It’s not what you think!”

“Oh?” Ilya raised an eyebrow. “I think it is exactly what I think.” She scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Your servant is a monster who can’t comprehend normal human mannerisms.”

“No, it’s…” Arkk trailed off, glancing back at Vezta. The servant was still kneeling but was no longer bowing. Her back was upright as she watched the goings on with a smile. “Yes. Probably that. Or else she does comprehend humans and is just trying to embarrass me.”

“I would never,” Vezta said, returning to her feet. Arkk could not decide if the tone in her voice was sincere or sarcastic.

“Never mind that,” Ilya said, tossing something toward Arkk. “Did you know about this?”

Arkk caught a coin. A heavy coin that gleamed a brilliant gold in the light from the library’s glowstones. One side had the same compass rose that was stamped on every corridor tile. Like the tiles, it had a little blue-violet gemstone set directly in the center of the coin. The other side was a labyrinthine maze, much like the [HEART].

Hearing clanking, Arkk glanced up to find Ilya holding out a whole fistful of identical coins.

“Where did you find these? Some treasure room?”

“They were sitting around the heart chamber. Arkk, just the amount in my hands makes you wealthier than the Baron, probably, and there were three piles up to my *knees*.”

“Transmutation,” Vezta said, leaning forward. She plucked the coin from Arkk’s hands, looking over it before handing it back. “The servants recycled the material from the old rooms. You should be able to use this to construct proper replacements, defenses, furnishings, and so forth.”

“Wait, wait,” Ilya said, holding up her free hand. “You’re saying those things eat whatever they want and vomit it up as gold?”

“Nothing so *crude*,” Vezta said, annoyed.

“You’re upset I’m calling *that* crude?” Ilya pointed a finger at the bubbling pustule of flesh, eyes, and maws.

It gurgled like the world’s emptiest stomach as it ripped off a rotted plank from the wall, shredding it with its teeth. One of its eyes *popped* as a fresh replacement bubbled up from under its oily flesh, though it somehow managed to not get gunk all over the place. Magic, probably.

“Right,” Ilya said. “I rest my case.”

Vezta pressed her lips together. “I’ll see about teaching them better,” she said, retaking her seat in front of one of the thick tomes. Several shadowy, dripping tendrils sprouted from her back. Each picked up a pen and she began scrawling out the copy of the book onto fresh vellum at an absurd speed. “As soon as I finish my priority task.”

Ilya stepped forward, grabbing hold of Arkk’s shoulder. “Do you know what this means?” she asked, waving the hand still full of gold. A few coins fell, but she didn’t seem to mind.

“I’m rich?” When Ilya narrowed her eyes, Arkk tried again, “*We’re* rich?”

“It means you better be *real* careful about who hears about this place. If word spreads about a handful of gold coins sitting in the middle of the Cursed Forest, people are going to come searching. This much coin and I’m sure everyone and their mother will be after it. Hell, half the people would probably be willing to stab their own mothers just for what I’ve got in my hand.”

“Assaults on Fortress Al-Mir are not an uncommon occurrence,” Vezta said, not looking up from her work. “In its current state, defending against an army would be perilous. I should be more than adequate to deal with any common thief.”

Ilya threw a glare in Vezta’s direction before shifting that glare to Arkk.

Arkk barely paid attention to her, however, rolling a gold coin between his fingers as he thought.

The fortress was a strange oddity. But it was just that. An oddity. Something he wanted to use, along with Vezta, to learn more magic from. More than that? Vezta kept calling it the ultimate defensive and offensive tool. He hadn’t thought much about what that meant. He didn’t see how a stationary building could be an offensive tool.

This, however, got his mind working. While he was sure it wasn’t what Vezta had meant, a way to *create* gold could certainly count as an offensive weapon. Gold could get him mercenaries, food and supplies, craftsmanship, materials, and just about anything else he could think of.

“How much gold can we get out of this place, Vezta?”

“I am unsure. My former master chose this location due to the presence of a large deposit of gold underneath the fortress. I do not believe he managed to mine even a small fraction of it.”

“We’re sitting on a gold mine?” Ilya said, looking faint. “This is going to draw the Duke’s attention.”

“Only if people find out. I’m not going to tell. You aren’t going to either. Vezta won’t.” Arkk tapped the gold coin on the desk, listening to the clink. “Maybe we can use this.”

“Arkk…”

“Hear me out. Your mother—”

“My *mother*,” she hissed. “The Duke took her as a tribute after a season of poor harvest. What has that got to do with this?”

“We couldn’t pay then, but now—”

Ilya’s face hardened. “Arkk… We’ve talked about this. You were barely old enough to remember and I was young too. The other villagers say he was after Mother for *years*, just looking for an excuse to take her. A fistful of gold isn’t going to make him—”

“You don’t know that. This changes things.” He held up the coin, looking at his shiny glint in the light of the library’s glowstones. “We have to *try*. She raised me. Taught me to read. Told me about my magic ability. It is the least I can do for her.”

“If it isn’t enough? If he isn’t interested?” Silver eyes flashed with a dangerous glint, defiant. Like she didn’t want to dare hope for the possibility of seeing Alya again.

“With this much gold, *someone* will be interested. I always thought we were trapped in Langleey. Trapped with our lot in life,” Arkk said with a sigh. Ilya stared at Arkk, then looked over his shoulder, staring at Vezta for a long moment. “This is an opportunity. I know you want your mother back.”

Arkk looked around the room, first at the books. Although he held out hope that they would be able to find a way to translate them, they *were* worthless at the moment. With as much gold as Ilya had in her hands, he could probably just go to the city and *buy* all the spell books he wanted and then some. Vezta… had something she wanted done as well. The first step of which was to find a capable spellcaster or for Arkk to learn magic himself. The latter would likely take too long but with gold, he could hire someone.

His parents had died when he was young. Before he could remember them. After that, Alya, Ilya’s mother, raised him. He remembered more of Alya than of his parents, but even that wasn’t much. Just a beautiful woman with a caring look in her eyes who was always there when Jorgen and Hurtt were being cruel. If not for Alya, he might not have learned to read and write.

“I want her back,” Ilya admitted, voice a slight whisper.

Vezta stood, turning to face Ilya and Arkk. Her tendrils continued scribing behind her back. “Master Arkk, forgive my impudence but I overheard your plans.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow. “We weren’t trying to hide. We weren’t even speaking quietly.”

“Most benevolent,” Vezta said with a slight bow. “However, in lieu of proper advisors, allow this servant to fulfill that role. Fortress Al-Mir is the ultimate offensive tool, but it is not yet in an operational state. We require additional funds to construct rooms and facilities. There are no employees to operate the rooms or serve as martial forces. In addition, you are inexperienced with the operation of the [HEART] and have a limited repertoire of spells, one of the [HEART]’s greatest offerings is vast magical power, growing ever larger as it acquires territory and employees. Opening the portal will solve several of these issues, but not all of them. Engaging in conflict with a Duke, who presumably has a standing army, is… not ideal at the present time.”

“Woah, woah, hold on.” Arkk glanced to Ilya. “We’re not starting a war with the Duke.”

Some, but not all, of Vezta’s eyes blinked. “Were you not proposing we hire additional forces using the gold?”

“I…” Arkk started, looking at Ilya. “Mercenaries, yes. Someone has to be willing to take a job to rescue an elf from the Duke, right? Probably demihumans and beastmen over humans… But not… war.”

“We just need to meet with him first,” Ilya said before either of them could get out of hand. “If he does accept a fistful of gold, then we should take it long before we start plotting anything more violent.”

“Rescue,” Arkk said.

“Whatever.” Ilya’s eyes shifted toward the ritual circles on the floor in the back of the library. There were two, side by side. One went to Langleey Village, the other went to the opposite side of the Cursed Forest which they had used to recover their hunting supplies. “Can you make another one of those to the city? Cliff?”

“That depends on the distance, but…” Vezta turned her head away from Ilya. “Master Arkk, forgive my impu—”

“You don’t need to say that every time. I’m not going to take offense at anything you say.”

“You are dressed like a [simpleton]/[peasant]/[village idiot].”

Arkk pressed his lips together, glancing down at his leather tunic and hemp undershirt. Ilya snorted, donning a smile at Vezta’s comment until she realized that she was dressed in nearly identical clothing.

“Okay. I might take *some* offense at the things you say.”

“If you are wishing to meet with a duke as equals—or at least lessen the gap in your status—a change of attire is [required],” Vezta said. “My master is greater than any duke, earl, or king. I *cannot* have you carrying on as you are if you are to meet with such individuals of objectively lower standing.”

“Then what do you suggest,” Arkk said, crossing his arms.

A tendril snapped out from under Vezta’s dress. She used it to pick up one of the fallen gold coins. Handing it off to her actual hand, she rolled it between her knuckles before pinching it between her thumb and fingers. “Allow me to show you how the [HEART] is meant to operate.”

## 09 - Fortress Al-Mir's New Room


Arkk stood inside an empty chamber within Fortress Al-Mir. At one point in time, it had been a barracks, foundry, or training room. He wasn’t sure. Regardless, the lesser servants had eaten everything inside, leaving just smooth stone tiles, each bearing the compass rose and blue-violet gemstone.

A small pile of gold sat on the floor next to him. Gold was heavy, surprisingly so. Even the small fistful that Ilya had been carrying around weighed as much as a full-size lumber axe. It would have taken a few trips from the [HEART] chamber were it not for Vezta helpfully informing him that he could transport not just people, but things as well. Anything that belonged to him could be moved near instantly simply by thinking about it.

Now, he had to do a bit more thinking.

He knew what looms were, even if he had never seen a proper one. Just the one that the local village tailor used to make the clothes he wore now. Vezta had helped, sketching out detailed plans for the room. Holding the sketch tight in his mind, Arkk stretched out a hand toward the pile of gold and pushed out a touch of his magic.

The room changed before his eyes. Bolts of colorful cloth formed in the walls, set on great reels. Large spools of thread looped over wheels and dangled from the ceiling. Four large machines covered in wheels, thread, and cloth popped into existence around the center of the room. Tall wooden mannequins covered in pins and partially-finished clothing sprung up near the sides of the room. Scissors and needles hung from walls while machines for sewing appeared on tables.

The torches vanished so as to not cause fires. Thankfully. In their place, glowing stones provided bright and almost natural light to the room.

Arkk had no frame of reference beyond the village tailor, and yet, he had a feeling that this place would rival even that of the tailors of Cliff. If nothing else, he had just created bolts of cloth from nothing.

Well, not quite nothing.

Looking down at his feet, Arkk found a mere two and a half coins remaining from the small fortune he had started with. Still, he couldn’t exactly call himself disappointed with the outcome. Just running his hand over a spool of blue cloth felt like it should be against the realm’s laws. Someone like him touching something so smooth and soft?

Ilya and Vezta approached from the door to the room. The former stared with wide eyes, lightly touching her fingers to one of the bolts of cloth much as Arkk was doing. The latter simply looked around, nodding to herself. Vezta didn’t look impressed at all, but that was probably to be expected if her former master was capable of feats such as this.

“It would behoove you to hire skilled tailors to operate this room,” she said, completing her inspection. “The lesser servants may craft some minor goods here, but this room is wasted on them in the end.”

“I… guess I’ll keep it in mind?”

“Wait,” Ilya said, regaining her stony look. “Wait. Those things are going to be touching our clothes?”

“Is that a problem?”

“Yes. Yes, it is. Arkk, tell her it is.”

Arkk shrugged. “I mean, they cleaned up the corridors without leaving slime everywhere.”

“*Arkk*.”

“It isn’t like there are many options. I guess we can grab Higgens, but…” Arkk tugged on his shirt, which Higgens had made. “Do you think he’ll be able to make anything better?”

“No…” Ilya trailed off, looking to the door.

As if called by their conversation, one of the lesser servants squirmed into the room. Ilya glared, moving between the bolts of cloth and the servant. Vezta, however, calmly approached. A tendril snapped out, wrapping around the lesser servant and holding it in place. With her bare hands, she tore into the servant, ripping pieces off and shoving other pieces into its body. A tentacle flew across the room but didn’t make it to the floor before vanishing into motes of blue-violet light.

The servant squirmed and screamed, a hideous noise like a rabbit frightened by a fox. Even still, Vezta did not stop, clawing it to pieces.

Arkk turned away, a grimace on his face. He wasn’t quite sure what Vezta was doing, but he could feel the link to the lesser servant. It was in pain, but it wasn’t dying. She wasn’t trying to kill it.

The screeching stopped after a few moments. Arkk finally looked back, only to pop his brows up in surprise.

Vezta set a small creature on the ground. A creature that looked remarkably like she did. A small Vezta that barely came up to the knees of the larger version. With a nudge of her tentacle, Vezta sent the smaller version of herself scuttling toward the wooden mannequins.

“They require aristocratic attire,” she said before turning to Ilya. “Pleased?”

Ilya, who had been standing as still as Arkk had during that… process, shuddered. “I… think I’m going to be sick,” she said, rushing out of the room.

“Master, your minion is difficult to please.”

Arkk wasn’t exactly feeling the best either, but he still forced a smile. “Employee, Vezta. Are you going to do that to the others?”

“Perhaps in time, if you wish. For now, they are more useful as they are. May I recommend sending them to the lowest level of the fortress to clear the path to the mine? Unless my former master was exceedingly vigorous in his final moments, there should be a plentiful supply of gold beneath us. Perhaps not enough to sate a lord’s lust for wealth, but enough to fulfill your immediate goals of bribing nobles or hiring mercenaries.”

“How large is the gold mine under us?”

“Plentiful,” Vezta repeated. “If not, I know there is a way to use the [HEART] to conjure gold, though I am unsure of the specifics. You will have to research that.”

“Add it to my list,” Arkk mumbled.

Somehow, Vezta heard him. “Current goals: Return Fortress Al-Mir to full power. Become a master I idolize. Open the portal to the [UNDERWORLD]. Revert the Calamity. Recover Ilya’s mother. Research magic. Research gold conjuration.” Vezta paused, frowning. “Master, nearly all these goals were imposed upon you by myself. I exist to serve *your* goals, not Ilya’s or even my own.”

“Your goals *are* my goals,” Arkk said. “I wouldn’t have agreed with them if I didn’t want to. You aren’t pushing me around if that is what you’re thinking.”

“But—”

Arkk held up a hand. “There are a lot of things I want and a lot of things I’m sure I’ll want in the future. But I do have one immediate interest…” For a moment, Arkk focused on Ilya. As his *employee*, he could see her just about anywhere. He didn’t like looking in on her, but right now? He wanted to make sure Ilya wasn’t nearby.

She wasn’t. She was back in the library—the only other furnished room at the moment—sitting in one of the chairs. She looked a little green in the face, but she was otherwise fine.

And out of earshot.

“What you said this morning, about starting a war with the Duke? I didn’t want to say it in front of Ilya, but that is a whole lot closer to what I want than I might have let on.”

“As I said, Fortress Al-Mir is not yet—”

Arkk stopped her with a raised hand. “I don’t want an *actual* war. But deposing him? Replacing him with someone, *anyone* else?” Arkk’s hand clenched into a fist. “That man sends his tax collectors around every harvest season. We owe them a full half of what we harvest. I talk to everyone who passes through the village. All the mercenaries and beastmen, all the demihumans and adventurers. Mostly, I talk to the spellcasters, but I still talk to the others.

“I’ve heard that the food goes to waste. Just rots. Sometimes, they toss it on the roads outside Cliff City because their storehouses are too full. Every village in the province harvests all this food that just goes bad? It’s supposed to be feeding armies and soldiers. People who *protect* us? And yet orcs and goblins a few hundred strong roam the land unimpeded. They would have destroyed our village if not for you and me… if not for you.”

Arkk clenched his teeth, squeezing his eyes shut. “And if we fail? If the harvest doesn’t meet the quotas? If a drought or pestilence claims our crops? The Duke doesn’t hand out that abundance of food he takes from the other villages to help us through tough times. No, he starts taking other things. Horses, tools… *Ilya’s mother*.”

Breathing, calming down, Arkk slowly opened his eyes. Vezta simply stood in front of him, staring without judging. She had her slight smile in place as her eyes burned.

“I came back to you… I made that contract with you… It wasn’t just to save the village. Ilya wanted to go to the Duke. I couldn’t let her. If… I fear that if the Duke catches sight of her and sees how beautiful Ilya is… he’ll snatch her up as well. Then she’ll be gone.” Arkk let his hands fall to his sides, limp. “Then I…”

Arkk didn’t finish his sentence. He just stared down at the ground, down where Vezta’s tendrils were unusually still, though they still dripped their dark oil. It somehow managed to avoid reaching the stone, absorbed back into her body.

“Sorry for springing that on you. Just forget it. It isn’t something I ever thought would be possible, but as Ilya said with that handful of gold, *this* changes things. But probably still too much to ask.”

“On the contrary, my master. I am in awe of your ambition. You have a single functional room and a single minion apart from myself. And we’re plotting a coup.” Vezta leaned closer. “I *am* excited.”

“You think we can do it?”

“Of course, though not soon. We might want to open the portal sooner rather than later, however. The Cloak of Shadows could provide useful minions or blessings for such a task.”

“Cloak of Shadows?”

“A member of the [PANTHEON]. Rules the night, secrets, stealth, and other such related matters.”

Arkk rubbed his chin. This opening the portal business, and undoing the *Calamity*, was something he wanted to talk to Ilya about before actually starting. He had made a promise to her and that felt like something he should mention, just in case.

Nodding slowly, he took a breath. “We’ll focus on trying to get back Ilya’s mother first. Whether we try to depose the Duke now or later, at least she’ll be out of the way. He won’t have her as a hostage.”

“Understood,” Vezta said with a bow. “In that case, I believe my inferior copy would like to take your measurements.”

Arkk turned to find the knee-high Vezta holding up a flexible strip of leather with several markings on it, denoting distance. It stood atop one of the stools in the room, though even with that added height, it wouldn’t be able to reach halfway up his chest. He glanced back to the real Vezta, raising an eyebrow.

“As I said,” she sighed, “best hire some *proper* tailors. I suppose I better help it out.”

***

Arkk sat over a desk in a newly recreated library. Gone were the musty shelves and broken furniture. The only books that remained were the few he had saved and the few he had copied. In place of the rest were empty, depressing shelves. It was a small consolation that the furnishings of the room had been replaced with comfortable seats. The reading lights made from glowstones weren’t too bright, yet weren’t dim enough to cause a strain on the eye.

He wasn’t copying books at the moment. While Ilya had her measurements taken, Arkk had decided to do a bit more planning.

At the moment, he hated their plan. If it could even be called that. Walking up to the Duke and throwing money at him had to be the worst decision, well-fitting clothes or not. They would seem desperate and the gold would come across as suspicious. They might not get a chance to hire mercenaries if the Duke found cause to throw them in prison. Arkk might be able to use the [HEART] or Vezta to get them out, but winding up in that position in the first place would be bad.

He had come up with a list of a few priorities.

First and foremost was *not* actually to rescue Alya. It was to prevent Ilya from falling into the Duke’s hands.

The easiest way to prevent that would be to have her simply not go anywhere near Cliff. But Arkk doubted Ilya would be willing to go along with that. She would want to be front and center in this.

So, the next best option would be to make her untouchable. Ilya couldn’t be a peasant from some village in the duchy. She had to be someone important, whose absence would be noted and investigated. To that end, wealthy-looking attire would be a great benefit. He wasn’t quite sure how to play it out, but it was something to discuss with Vezta and Ilya.

The second priority was, also, not to rescue Alya, but to keep the [HEART] secret and secure. Even with just the little he had seen thus far, the room construction and the gold creation, the servants, and Vezta herself, it seemed like the kind of thing a man like the Duke would covet above anything else. To say nothing of all the capabilities Vezta implied it could demonstrate. That might sound like the kind of thing that could be traded for Alya’s freedom, but Arkk would rather die than let a man like the Duke have the [HEART].

For the third priority, Arkk started to write down Alya’s rescue but crossed it off. He started to replace it with protecting himself and Vezta, needing to be safe and free to carry out the rest of the tasks on his list, but he didn’t quite make it before a flash of light sparked from one of the two magic circles in the room.

A young girl with black hair tied into two tight ponytails stumbled into the room.

Arkk lurched to his feet. “Hale? What are you… *How* did you get here—”

Hale’s dark eyes locked onto Arkk’s. Wide-eyed and obviously terrified, a small bit of relief crept into her expression as recognition took hold. She launched herself at him, trembling. “Orcs in the village!” she blurted out. “I saw them, orcs!”

Some of Hale’s panic rubbed off on Arkk. He felt the palms of his hands start to sweat. Almost on instinct, he ripped Ilya and Vezta into the room. The latter didn’t look surprised or alarmed in the slightest. Ilya, shirt half off over her head, stumbled. The only thing that saved her from a fall to the ground was the grace of her elfish reflexes. She rammed her shirt back down over herself and shot a ferocious glare at Arkk.

“What do you think you’re—” She spotted Hale and blinked. The scorn in her voice vanished, replaced with surprise and concern. “What do you think *you’re* doing here? Arkk, did you—”

“The orcs you saw, Hale, did others see them?”

She nodded her head into Arkk’s chest. “John saw them. He started shouting for others.”

Ilya’s face went paler than normal, though Vezta simply stood with her usual smile in place.

“Were they attacking?”

“I don’t know, I…” Hale pushed herself back, steadying herself. She took a breath. “I said I would get help,” she said, shooting Arkk a nervous smile. “I saw you use the circle thing many times, so I knew how to use it too.”

It took a touch of magic to get working. Arkk hadn’t known that Hale could use magic. He filed that away for later. Looking to the side, he met Ilya’s gaze and nodded. “You go first,” he said. “You can’t use the circles on your own. Vezta, with her. I’ll follow.”

Vezta bowed and a series of tendrils emerged from the ground around her, ripping and pulling at her in much the same way as she had done to the lesser servant earlier. Rather than transform herself into a small version, the tendrils pulled her down into the ground. A bright golden eye opened in the oily pool that had been Ilya’s shadow. Ilya glanced down at it with a wrinkle on her nose but didn’t argue. She hurried to the ritual circle but stopped just before entering it. Looking back to Arkk, she narrowed her eyes. “My bow?”

Since recovering her bow, Ilya had been carrying it everywhere. Except now. She must have taken it off while with the miniature Vezta. Mentally searching through the Fortress, he found it resting against the wall not far from the lesser servant in the tailor's room. Much like pulling Ilya and Vezta to him, Arkk tugged on the bow.

It appeared in the air just above Ilya’s extended hand along with a quiver full of arrows. Taking a split second to examine it, she nodded to herself and stepped into the ritual circle.

In a flash, they disappeared to the village.

“You stay here, Hale. We’ll be back when it is safe.”

“I can help too!” she said, taking another breath. “I can use a bow. I helped last time after we saw your lightning bolt!”

“Last time I went through that circle when the goblins were attacking, they had it surrounded. If you go through, they might be on the other side. They’ll get you before you have a chance to draw your bow. I’m sorry,” he said, then had a thought.

The miniature Vezta popped into the library, standing atop the chair Arkk had been sitting on. He turned to it and pointed at Hale. “She is important. Your other duties are on hold until we get back. Keep her safe here, understand?”

The little thing nodded its head without hesitation. It couldn’t fight. Just because it looked like Vezta didn’t make it any stronger of a lesser servant. But it could keep Hale from stumbling around the place. Although the servants had cleaned up, there were still a few areas that could be dangerous. That pit in the [HEART] chamber, for one. Not that those heavy iron doors would open for anyone. It probably wouldn’t be able to stop Hale if she were determined to use the magic circle to get back to the village, but *Hale* didn’t know that.

Patting Hale on the head, Arkk hurried to the circle. It took a mere instant to check that Ilya and Vezta were clear.

He disappeared in a flash.

## 10 - Orcs and Offers


Like last time, Arkk expected to find himself thrust into combat the moment he was through the ritual circle. Instead, he found the air oddly calm and lacking in the sounds of battle. Hurrying around the carpentry workshop, Arkk spotted a group gathered out near the bridge over the river.

A divide ran through the group. On one side, wary villagers took up arms with whatever weapons they had been able to grab. They didn’t look nearly as organized as they had been while preparing for the initial defense a week ago. Across from the villagers, a quintet of orcs stood, shuffling in obvious nervousness.

At first, Arkk thought they might have been an entirely different group of orcs, ignorant of the horde that had attacked just days prior. It wasn’t like orcs were a species constantly trying to pillage and raid. Just the opposite. In contrast to the few hostile, many orcs were like any other being trying to live their lives. Not an easy prospect in the Duke’s territory. As long as demihumans and beastmen avoided the main cities where the majority of the Duke’s army patrolled, it was perfectly possible.

Or so he heard from the various visitors to the village over the years.

Arkk’s suspicions reignited upon examining them a little closer. They wore armor, not clothes. Two wielded crossbows, gripped tight in gloved fingers, while the other three had a mix of axes and pikes. These were not simple travelers. They were mercenaries at best. Given recent history, they were almost certainly from the horde that had attacked the village.

But they weren’t fighting *now*.

Arkk hurried over, a dozen paces behind Ilya and Vezta, the latter still in the former’s shadow.

John moved to intercept him and Ilya, concern on his face even as he gripped one of his lumber axes tight in his hands. “Hale? Where is Hale?”

Ilya glanced back, meeting Arkk’s eyes.

“She’s safe. I told her to stay put for now. What’s going on?”

A flicker of relief crossed John’s countenance as he half-turned. “I think they want to speak with you. They won’t talk to anyone but the ‘Warrior of Lightning’.” He paused, pressing his lips together. “I saw Hale disappear. Just… gone.”

“She’s safe,” Arkk said again. “Though I didn’t know she could use magic.”

“Nor I,” John said, looking back to the orcs. “I knew she had talent, but… I suspect she’ll want to apprentice herself to you now.”

Ilya let out a hefty scoff, rolling her eyes. Arkk just shook his head. “I don’t know magic.”

Despite the tense atmosphere, John still managed to inject a little sarcasm into his tone. “Oh? I suppose you’re not the ‘Warrior of Lightning’ then.”

“Okay. I know one spell, a ritual or two, and a lot of ways of blowing things up.” Arkk shook his head again. “Later. We need to deal with this. Any idea what they want?”

“You. Maybe your head on a pike? Maybe just a chat. They didn’t say much.” John paused, then added, “Glad you kept her away. This could get messy. Hurtt and Jorgen are ready to hammer their heads in. The Baron is with the other villagers, but Abbess Keena went to fetch him as soon as the orcs started demanding to talk to you.”

“No sign of goblins?”

John waved a hand. “Don’t know anything else beyond what you see.”

“Great. At least nothing is burning yet.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, taking a deep breath. Talking with visitors to the village was normally the Baron’s duty. The Baron wasn’t a fighter, nor did he possess much physical strength *to* fight if necessary. He spent his spare time whittling toys for the village children. An activity that made him popular but wouldn’t help here if the situation turned chaotic.

Ilya met his eyes. She nodded her head ever so slightly, then stepped aside. “They want to talk with the one who beat them.”

“Right.”

Arkk stepped forward. John stayed a step behind to one side and Ilya, with Vezta, stayed on the other side. He stopped a few paces away from the orcs, not sure at all what to say to them. Up close, they were all at *least* a head taller than he was. Ilya was far more their vertical equal, yet their eyes were locked on him. The silence was going to grow even more uncomfortable if he didn’t say *something*, however, so he opened his mouth.

“You would dare return here?”

He felt like cringing the moment the words were out of his mouth. Was threatening the right move? Was that even threatening? It didn’t *sound* like it. Arkk had a hard time seeing himself as threatening, but… well, lightning was an incantation away. Vezta’s darkness was slowly spreading out underneath their feet as well, though it didn’t look like the orcs noticed in the dying sunlight. Her tendrils would probably crush all five of them in an instant.

Maybe he *was* intimidating.

One of the orcs snorted, baring his teeth. “The human doesn’t look like a monster of lightning and shadow and fury. *Demonstrate*.”

“Demonstrate lightning? By frying one of you?”

Another orc, the smallest of the group, grabbed the metal armguards of the first, tugging on him. “I saw his face. That’s the one that turned Jakk’en to ash.”

Arkk didn’t remember turning anyone, goblin or orc, to *ash*, but if he was being vouched for, he supposed he shouldn’t complain. Instead, he straightened his back, trying his best to look even a little more intimidating. The orc in the lead, a hulk of muscle with a flat face and thick black hair from his ears to his chin, just snorted again.

Arkk blamed the height difference. It was hard to intimidate someone so large.

The shorter orc, who still stood a head over Arkk, was a woman with grayer, more tan-colored skin and dark hair braided tight against her skull on the sides but hung loose on top. She stepped forward. “We have come to seek your aid,” she said. She opened her mouth to say more but caught the closed fist of the taller orc in the stomach instead. Aside from a brief step back and a snarl revealing sharp lower tusks, she didn’t react. None of the other orcs looked concerned in the slightest.

“Aid?” Hurtt called from somewhere behind Arkk. “Burning down more villages?”

“Kill ‘em before they can try!” Jorgen shouted.

Arkk felt more than saw John turn at his side. He assumed John did *something* because a brief rallying cry from a few of the other assembled villagers cut off before it could really begin.

The lead orc didn’t move his eyes from Arkk. He crossed his arms, curling a lip to show his tusk. “You killed our chief’s brother,” he said, tone surprisingly neutral, though it still had an exaggerated snarl under the words. Most orcs spoke with a guttural growl, but he was laying it on thick.

Arkk had no idea how to respond to the accusation. It was probably true. He *had* killed several orcs. “Shouldn’t have attacked?” he tried.

One of the others, the older orc, snorted. Laughed, even? Arkk wasn’t the best at reading orcs. Especially angry orcs.

“Any other orc and we would have moved on. Found easier prey. But the chief wants revenge for her brother.”

“They’re coming back?” someone behind Arkk whispered.

Someone else, far louder, barked out a forced laugh. “Arkk and Vezta will thrash them again. These are the cowards, running away!”

*That* comment got the lead orc to unleash a full snarl, taking an aggressive step forward. Two of the others grabbed his arms, barely keeping him a step outside Vezta’s shadow. Arkk might have backed up from that if it weren’t for Vezta. She had tendrils at his back, snaked up his legs under his trousers, forcing him to maintain his stance.

“The chief captured travelers off the road,” another tan-skinned orc, bald with a wrinkled and battle-scarred face, barked out. As he spoke, Arkk noted that he didn’t seem to have tusks. His teeth were not that different from a human’s, though aged and missing one or two. “She’s going use them to summon a demon to fight your monster. *Tonight*.”

The jeers and laughs from the villagers cut off instantly. The shadows underneath Arkk’s feet twisted in a way that he could only describe as anger. A sharp gasp from the approaching Abbess took Arkk’s attention off the orcs for a moment. Long enough to see the Baron at her side topple backward, fainting. That got a raucous round of laughter from the orcs.

All except for the shortest one. She took another step forward. “The chief will destroy us all! Some fled already. She killed or captured those trying to flee. Most support her,” she said, teeth clenched together. Her fists clenched. “You don’t care about us, but the demon will come for you next. *Help us*.”

“Help you?” Jorgen shouted. “So you can go back to raiding other villages?”

“Or stab us in the back.”

“Kill ‘em! And the summoner!”

The orc backed up in line with the others, all of whom now looked far warier. They weren’t quite brandishing their weapons, but they were a lot closer now that they were facing an angry mob. *Angrier* mob.

Arkk’s heart hammered in his chest. *Demons*. He didn’t know *exactly* what a demon was. A deal maker that could grant almost any wish in exchange for a price too steep for *anyone* to pay. His mouth felt dry. Could he and Vezta fight a demon? Vezta was strong, but as she said, she was not a fighter. Even against pathetic goblins, they had almost been overwhelmed. A demon would likely be far stronger than dozens of goblins.

They had to kill the summoner before the demon could appear. It was the only option. And without knowing where the summoner was…

“We can’t kill them,” Arkk said, turning his back to the orcs to face the villagers. “They know where—”

“She wants *you*!”

Arkk spun back around at the cry. “*Electro Deus*!” he shouted before he even saw the orc rushing him with a pike. Lightning sparked from his fingertips, catching the charging orc in his chest. An arrow appeared between his eyes, fired from over Arkk’s right shoulder. At the same time, oily tendrils sprouted from the shadows, looping around the orc’s arms and legs. Pulling him taut, the tendrils twisted in opposite directions.

A broken, skewered, smoking corpse hit the ground long before it could reach him.

Arkk’s extended hand slowly moved over the rest of the orcs. The older orc didn’t move, but the shorter orc flinched back. The leader set his jaw and glowered. The fourth, a bulbous orc even rounder than the Baron, shirked back, using the woman for cover as he cowered. “We didn’t… it wasn’t…”

“We agreed,” the old orc said, looking down at the broken body with a gaze of utter contempt.

After a brief moment of shocked silence from the mob behind him, Arkk heard Hurtt shout out a *huzzah*! Arkk could *feel* the pressure on his back. The villagers wanted blood even though it *should* have been obvious that the other four hadn’t been planning on attacking him like that. If they had been, they all would have attacked at the same time.

“Master.” Vezta used her tendrils to pull herself from the ground at Arkk’s side, an action that made *everyone*, villager and orc, take a sudden step back. Only Ilya resisted, more used to the servant than the others. “You clearly cannot let these creatures see your back. If I might offer a solution—”

“I know,” Arkk said. “Hire them. They can’t betray me if what you said is true.”

“They *can*, but you’ll know in advance.”

“Right.”

“In addition, it solves more problems,” she said, speaking softly. “Fortress Al-Mir can sustain any number of creatures, providing everything they need with the proper rooms constructed. There will be no need for them to pillage and raid. It keeps them from raiding your village, or any other. In addition, we gain minions. If we wish to progress with your *other* goals, minions—”

“Employees, Vezta.”

“Regardless of the word, they will be an asset.”

“You want to hire *them*?” Ilya hissed, close enough to hear Vezta. “You heard them, they were happy to go on raiding if not for this demon business.”

“I gave my reasons,” Vezta said, stepping aside.

“They’re *not* good people.”

Arkk held up a hand, locking his eyes on the green-skinned lead orc. “When is this summoning to take place?”

“When the sun is farthest from directly overhead,” he said, no longer willing to play games. “You humans call it the witching hour.”

Glancing to the horizon, Arkk frowned. The sun was starting to set. They had but a few hours.

“Regardless of your decision with the orcs, you *must* stop this summoning, Master,” Vezta said, voice far more intense than usual. “Demons are the enemy of *all*.”

“Agreed,” Ilya said, hand tightening around the leather grip of her bow.

“How many orcs and goblins are still present?” Arkk asked of the assembled orcs. “How many are likely to fight with your chief or fight against her if we show up and start attacking? How well-defended is she? Can we kill her from afar—”

The shortest orc started talking, only for the lead orc to snap his hand into a fist in front of her face. “No more answers until you guarantee our safety.”

Someone started to say something behind Arkk, but John snapped *his* fingers, cutting them off before they could cause a commotion.

Arkk pressed his lips together. He didn’t think he was cut out for this job, but he didn’t have a choice. Reaching his hand into his pocket, Arkk pulled four gold coins from Fortress Al-Mir’s [HEART] chamber in the same way he had moved Ilya’s bow earlier. Vezta had warned him that both that method of moving items, as well as her teleportation circles, would not function at great distances—which she estimated to be limited to about twice the distance from the fortress to the village, about a hundred kilometers, though she hadn’t known the measurement used in the duchy. Still, it worked for now.

“I will hire you,” Arkk said, holding the coins out, three in his palm and one pinched between his thumb and index finger. Paying gold, according to Vezta, was how her former master had most often hired his employees. “You work for me. No more raiding, pillaging, or looting. You do as I say.”

“Work for a *human*?” The lead orc curled his lips back into a snarl. “You dare—”

Idea popping into Arkk’s head, he held out his left hand. A crystal ball popped into being. The same one he had used to locate his village for Vezta when he first met the servant. He could transport anything that was *his* to anywhere that was his territory, which his body counted as.

The orcs flinched back at the ball’s appearance, but he simply held it over to his side, offering it to Vezta.

“Find the orc encampment,” he said, looking across the bridge. He spotted no horses. They could have left them behind to appear non-threatening, but more likely, they just didn’t have any. “Search that side of the river. Roughly six hours of walking distance. If you don’t find it, spread your search further. Riding distance in the same timeframe.”

“As you wish,” Vezta said, coiling a tendril around the crystal ball. Holding her hands above it, images started flashing inside the glass.

Leaving that to her, Arkk looked back to the orcs. “You have until she finds your chief,” he said.

“Or what?” the lead orc said, teeth clenched hard enough that Arkk was surprised they hadn’t started cracking.

“Or you will become *far* less useful,” he said, offering one of the golden coins.

The older orc caught his meaning immediately, followed quickly by the lead orc. He could see it in the way their eyes changed. The shorter orc didn’t take long either, her own eyes widening as she looked to the leader and then back to Arkk. He could see her fingers rubbing together, eyes darting down to the coin in Arkk’s hand.

Arkk wasn’t entirely sure that the rotund orc ever got exactly what Arkk was saying. He had been dripping sweat the entire time, especially after the fifth orc tried his attack. Arkk wondered just what he was doing with the other orcs, looking far more like those that passed through town than a raider. Perhaps he was forced to participate in their group?

When Vezta let out a soft, “Ah!” noise, it was the fat orc that lunged forward, grabbing hold of the coin.

The link formed immediately. Like with Ilya and unlike Vezta, it relayed off the [HEART]. He was now Arkk’s first *intentional* minion. Employee.

The other three looked at him with a mixture of expressions on their faces. The girl looked surprised while the leader looked like he was about to murder his comrade. The older orc simply sighed, resigned. He was the next to step forward. Then, after a brief hesitation, the girl.

The leader glared at both of them in turn, but the fires of his ire in his eyes died down with each. He was left looking at Arkk, a hefty scowl on his face. “We are not slaves,” he growled, unmoving.

“Do slaves get paid?” Arkk asked, the final coin still held out between his fingers.

Curling his lip, the lead orc swiped the coin from Arkk’s fingers. As the bond settled into place, a look of surprise came over the orc. He looked off into the distance, toward Fortress Al-Mir. For a moment, Arkk thought he noticed the bond forming, but if the orc did, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he looked down at the coin in his hand. He popped it into his mouth.

Arkk gaped for a moment, thinking he was eating it. He didn’t seem to be chewing or swallowing, however. In short order, the orc spat it back out. “Still cold? And no taste?” Genuine surprise laced his voice. “It’s real?”

His shock prompted all three of the other orcs to give the gold a taste test, though when the larger orc did, he actually bit down. With predictable results. With a slight ‘eep’ of pain, he spat it back out first and began rubbing at his teeth through his cheeks.

Shaking his head in bewilderment, Arkk turned to Vezta. “You found the encampment?”

Vezta’s faint smile turned into a wide grin. “Not yet. I merely decided to *encourage* their response. We are pressed for time, Master.”

“Right,” Arkk said, a bit of laughter escaping his lips. After a moment, he started laughing with gusto, nervous tension draining with each chuckle. Taking a breath, he nodded a head toward the orcs. “Find out everything you can from them.”

“As you desire.”

Turning fully, Arkk faced the villagers.

He expected to find anger at their vengeance being denied. Instead, he found himself faced with surprise. More eyes were over his shoulders than actually on him. It was only the Abbess and the Baron who weren’t staring. The former was kneeling next to the latter, gently patting his cheeks in an attempt to rouse him.

“Where’d a punk like you get *gold* from?” Jorgen blurted out.

Hurtt shot him a look. “Same place he got that monster from, idiot.”

“Not important!” Ilya snapped. “We’ve got an orc that just won’t accept no for an answer! Who is with us!” she shouted, raising her bow into the air.

The rallying cry was *significantly* less enthusiastic than when the cries to murder the orcs had gone out, but everyone looked determined to *some* degree.

Arkk didn’t know anything about demons and doubted any of them did either, but everyone knew a demon coming after their village would not end well. It might not even be the kind of thing they could run away from.

“The orcs here are not to be harmed,” Arkk said. “They won’t betray us without me knowing about it.” He looked over his shoulder, gaze sweeping over each of them. “And I won’t take kindly to that.”

“How do you know?”

Arkk looked back to the villagers but wasn’t sure who asked. He simply shrugged. “Magic.”

“Oh,” Jorgen said with a grimace. “You’re going to make them explode.”

“I’m not, I…” Arkk pressed his lips together, sighing. “Nothing I’ve done recently has exploded. Nothing since…”

Since binding with the [HEART].

Shaking his head, he looked to the Abbess. “Keena, anything you can provide that would harm a demon or protect us from it would be appreciated. And healing.”

The Abbess, white robes dusty from kneeling next to the Baron, met his eyes for the first time since he returned to the village with Vezta in tow. She only held his gaze for a moment before her eyes dropped down to the ground as she nodded. “Yes,” she said softly. “Of course.”

“Thank you.” He wasn’t sure what problem the Abbess had, but with how much Vezta seemed to dislike the symbols on her habit and on the church itself, he wasn’t all that surprised that the Abbess didn’t like Vezta in turn. If she knew what Vezta was, however, she wasn’t saying.

Still, she would *have* to help fight a demon. It would be insanity not to. Trusting *that*, Arkk turned back to the villagers.

“Anyone who wants to go, gather your weapons and horses. We need to move quickly. As soon as we know which direction to head. We’ll plan as we go!”

## 11 - The Barrows


“A barrow?” Arkk said with a scowl. There went his best plan.

The horde had holed up in an old burial mound some distance south and east of Langleey Village. He had been hoping for a nice open field where Ilya would have had a clear shot at the summoner from afar. Even if she couldn’t get a shot, somewhere open would have been better. Arkk had never been inside the barrows here. He knew from stories of mercenaries hunting down the odd necromancer that they weren’t spacious areas.

Tight quarters with around over a hundred goblins and a few dozen orcs sounded like a good way to get overwhelmed. If they were only attacked from one direction, the terrain might favor Vezta. Arkk couldn’t guarantee that, however.

“Is the summoning being conducted inside the barrow or out here?” Maybe there was still some hope for Ilya’s skills to put a quick end to the situation.

Olatt’an, the elderly orc with the battle-scarred face, shook his head. “The chief was preparing it within.”

“Damn.”

“Problem, ‘boss?’” Rekk’ar, the leader of the four orcs, said with a curl of his lip.

Arkk didn’t rise to his tone, instead taking the crystal ball from Vezta. He didn’t have as much control over it, being less experienced, but he had enough to scan through the tunnels beneath the earthen mound.

Goblins packed the tight corridors. There was only one entrance to the barrows, a narrow entrance that would probably force most orcs to duck as they walked through it. A short way in, the path split in three different directions. Following one goblin-stuffed path in the crystal ball, Arkk found what looked like a temporary barracks inside a larger chamber with skulls and other bones lining the walls. A little over a dozen orcs had cleared away the goblins, leaving space with small mats for sleeping on. The room and the corridors seemed to be lit with glowing stones similar to those that lit Fortress Al-Mir’s new library. Arkk wasn’t sure if they had been left behind by the ancients who had built the barrows or if the orcs had brought them in.

Following the center path, Arkk saw a much smaller chamber with a low altar. The altar was adorned with the same symbols as the Langleey church and it looked to have been built into the ground, meaning it was part of the original architecture. However, new symbols had been scrawled into the top using… well, it looked like blood, so it probably was. A much smaller orc stood hunched over the altar wearing a dark cowl and long robes, drawing a fresh profane symbol with her fingertips. It looked like she had cut her hand for the blood.

“That’s the chief,” Rekk’ar said, leaning over the crystal ball. “Fool,” he spat, watching her work.

“I thought orcs tended to follow the strongest of the group. She doesn’t look like much.” There were two other orcs in the room, standing near the entrance. Both towered over her. She might even have been shorter than Arkk or any other average human.

“Ah, but you don’t look like much either,” Olatt’an said, a smile creasing the wrinkles on his face. “Yet here we are, following you.”

“I… intimidated you into following me.”

Olatt’an nodded, then motioned toward the crystal ball. “The same is true here, though it is true that the only thing that saved the chief from being the runt of the group was her brother. Then she found that book in a village we… visited.” Tapping the ball, Olatt’an pointed at a thick tome that was *chained* to the cowled orc’s hip. A thick black book with glimmering red circles interlaced within each other on the cover.

Abbess Keena, though she stood a few paces away, narrowed her eyes. “The symbol of desecration,” she said, making a gesture with her right hand from her navel to her chin, then left shoulder to the left hand. She murmured a prayer as she did so.

“Whatever it is,” Olatt’an said, “it taught her magicks of foul nature. Put herself and her brother in charge after… embarrassing the previous leader.” Both Rekk’ar and Dakka, the shorter orc, looked to Olatt’an as he spoke with frowns spreading across their faces, but neither commented. “Turned our little group toward more vicious activities, taking more risks and… *subjugating* every goblin we came across. Be warned, the chief will not go down as easily as other orcs and the goblins will not fight against her.”

“Noted.”

After watching the summoner work for another moment, Arkk pulled the vision in the crystal ball back to the crossroads and followed the right path to another small open space inside the barrows. Goblins swarmed the room along with twelve heavily armed and armored orc guards.

“Humans!” John said with a gasp, looking over Arkk’s shoulder.

Three humans sat, huddled together. One was dressed in the tattered remains of what might have been a fancy suit at one point in time. To his left, someone wearing boiled leather armor tried to keep a straight back, but his face, black and blue with an eye swelled shut, looked like it had been used as a punching bag. A woman sat to his left, looking better than either of the other two yet still wearing the remains of a once fine dress. Arkk could see gashes along her arms and face, though none so bad as the armored man.

“The ones the chief is planning to sacrifice,” Rekk’ar said. “Looks like some more orcs have joined them.”

Six orcs were in the room as well, stripped of their weapons and armor. They sat apart from the humans yet they had not been treated any better.

“If we free them, they’ll help against the goblins and the chief?”

Rekk’ar crossed his arms. “We don’t speak for all orcs,” he said, then dipped his head slightly. “But it is likely, yes.”

“Good. Then—”

“Wait!” Dakka said, leaning close to the crystal ball. She pointed to two of the guards standing to the side of the room near the entrance. “That’s Orjja and Pett’en. They were thinking about leaving with us. If they knew there was another option…”

“Too late, girl,” Rekk’ar said with a sad shake of his head. “After our desertion, the chief will have her most loyal on watch. You’d never get in there. The most you can hope for is to shout in the fight and hope they hear over the bloodlust of battle.”

Dakka bared her tusks but slowly nodded. “Yes, sir,” she said, teeth clenched together.

The ones on watch, Arkk had already seen. The orcs had helped to point out where they would be. Three orcs stood outside the cave, crouched around a small campfire along with a bunch of goblins. But there were others, further out. The area around the barrows was made up of gently sloping hills with the occasional tree. Nothing as dense as a forest. Arkk had called the villagers and orcs to a stop well in advance of getting close specifically to avoid being spotted over the relatively empty plains.

“We need to take the watch out first,” Arkk said. “If we can get close before raising the alarm, we have a better chance at catching them before they bunker down. It looks like they rigged the entrance to collapse unless it was always that unsteady looking. Either way, *I* would drop the entrance, buying time to begin the summoning while any invaders were trying to dig their way in.”

“Master,” Vezta said, sliding forward. “If I may remind you of Fortress Al-Mir’s mines…”

“Mines? What… Oh. Oh!” Arkk’s eyes flashed with acknowledgment. “That… Does that work out here?”

“I don’t see why not. Those walls are hardly fortified and this barrow does not appear to have an active claimant that would hamper the magic of their teeth.”

“Got it,” Arkk said, mind churning over the possibilities. No matter what, however, they needed to deal with the watchers first to get closer. “These guards in the trees around the barrows need to go. Ilya, can you and…” Trailing off, Arkk looked over the group.

They had not brought most of the teens from the village. Only the eldest two. Nine men and six women had joined up. Of them, only Archie carried a bow. Despite his name, Arkk knew he was nowhere near a good enough shot to hit someone in a tree from a hidden spot.

Looking back to the orcs, Rekk’ar carried a particularly nasty-looking pike—more of a halberd—and Dakka wielded a shield covered in thick spikes alongside a battle axe large enough that Arkk doubted he could lift it. Olatt’an carried a crossbow but was quite the elderly man for an orc. The other carried a crossbow too, but… his size… any guard worth posting would see him coming long before he got within range.

“I didn’t catch your name,” Arkk said to the rotund orc.

The orc stiffened, drawing in a deep breath. “They, uh, they call me The Butcher,” he said, voice slightly deeper than normal.

“I’m not calling you that,” Arkk said, tone flat.

“Oh.” His shoulders slumped slightly, earning mocking laughs from all three of the other orcs. “I guess you can call me Larry then.”

“Larry.”

“That’s my name,” he said with a sigh.

“Not… Larr’ak or… something else?”

“No, I was raised among humans,” he said with a shrug. “Had a nice little shack to myself on the outskirts of Pineberg Burg. The village huntsmen would bring me their kills and I’d chop it up for them in exchange for keeping some for myself.”

Arkk blinked. “You were *literally* a butcher.”

“That’s what I said.”

Arkk closed his eyes and let out a small breath. “Why don’t we have you sit this one out?”

His comment got another round of laughs from the three orcs. Arkk got the distinct impression that they didn’t think too highly of their comrade here. Though, probably rightfully so. He didn’t look like a fighter and, if what he was saying was true, probably *wasn’t* a fighter.

How did he wind up in a group of raiders? A question for later. They only had about two hours before this ritual was supposed to begin. No time for chatting.

Arkk, left with little choice, looked to Vezta. He didn’t want to send her away. Without her at his side, even a small group of goblins would overrun him in moments.

Then again, this time he had the villagers at his back and the orcs, as long as the latter didn’t break their bond and backstab him, but he was fairly sure a lightning bolt was faster than a battle axe.

“Vezta, Ilya, can you take out the guards in the trees without alerting the others?”

“Of course,” Vezta said with a deep bow.

“Yeah. As long as your monster doesn’t get in my way.”

“I beg your pardon?”

“You—”

“Please,” Arkk said. “We need as much time as possible.”

Vezta bowed again and, after taking a few steps away from the group, tendrils ripped out from her own shadow, lashing around her as they pulled her down into the grass. That got a few gasps from everyone else around. Ilya headed off toward the southeast, opposite Vezta, drawing her black and white bow as she sprinted. Despite the speed at which she moved, Arkk heard nothing of her footsteps in the grass. Years of keeping silent and hidden from wild game would hopefully serve her well against the orc guards.

Luckily, orcs didn’t see any better in the darkness than humans did.

“Right,” Arkk said, waving both humans and orcs to his sides. “Don’t be too alarmed. *Slave Natum*,” he intoned.

“You know,” John said, “telling us not to be alarmed just makes me more nervous.”

“Might want to close your eyes,” Arkk said, pushing magic into the intoned spell.

A bubbling mass of flesh, eyes, and mouths formed before him, earning a groan from John.

“I was right.”

Arkk shook his head, focusing on summoning the lesser servants. He managed five before he started to feel the exhaustion. Stopping there, for now, he leaned down and whispered a few words. The lesser servants listened intently before turning away. Their bodies turned into one large mouth which promptly aimed downward at the ground. The five disappeared beneath the surface of the ground.

Turning back to find a group of sick villagers *and* orcs, Arkk frowned.

He wondered if Vezta could modify that spell so that miniature Veztas popped out instead.

Later.

“While they’re doing that, let’s go over the plan I have in mind…”

***

Arkk stood on the opposite side of the burial mound from the entrance. The large heap of earth was eerily silent. Being filled to the brim with goblins and orcs, Arkk would have expected some noise, but the air was as dead as those interred within.

Vezta and Ilya had been successful in their task, allowing Arkk, the villagers, and the orcs to approach the barrow. They had left the guards out front alone. They were too close and their deaths would surely cause a ruckus. Right now, Arkk had the element of surprise and he did *not* intend to give that advantage up.

A large hole now existed on this side of the mound where there had been none before. The lesser servants were swarming over the mound as Arkk directed. Why fight through a horde of goblins and trapped passages when he could simply make his own tunnels? He was just waiting on a few finishing touches.

Arkk glanced around, making eye contact with those around him. The majority of the villagers stood alongside him, as did Dakka, the brown-skinned orc warrior. She had a serious look in her eyes, staring at the incomplete tunnel ahead of them. No one spoke. Not even Jorgen and Hurtt. Everyone knew the plan and, with a few alterations suggested by Olatt’an and John, they had agreed that it sounded like the best course of action.

Olatt’an, along with Vezta, Ilya, Rekk’ar, and the braver villagers were a short distance away, positioned in front of a near identical hole in the mound. Vezta either sensed his gaze or noticed with the multitude of burning eyes positioned around her body. She turned her head, meeting his look with her *proper* eyes, and offered a small nod of her head.

Arkk could sense the lesser servants nearing the completion of their tasks. Turning his gaze to the crystal ball, he checked in on each of the rooms. Orcs in the makeshift barracks looked to be rousing each other. Likely in preparation for the ritual. Goblins still packed the corridors, but he was hoping to avoid dealing with the *majority* of them. There was movement in the prisoner's room as well. One of the guards looked to be having a bit of a disagreement with the others, who were advancing on the human prisoners.

They were running out of time.

The summoner herself seemed to have finished drawing her patterns on the altar in the barrow. She stood over it, inspecting her work. Arkk couldn’t hear through the crystal ball, but he watched as she barked out orders at the pair of guards in the chamber with her. One turned back to the corridors immediately, but the other hesitated. He opened his mouth, saying something.

The chieftain took exception. She raised a finger, muttering something. A bolt of sickly green light crossed the distance between them.

The guard started screaming, tugging at the skin on his face. Blood started boiling from his mouth, eyes, nose, and ears. Lacerations split his skin. Blood gushed from his chest and arms and even his fingernails. He collapsed in short order, shuddering a few times before going still.

All the while, the chieftain simply turned her back to him, hardly a care in the world as she looked back to the altar.

If she had been a little more attentive, she might have noticed the crack split the rock between her feet. The gap widened, splitting apart to the point where she did finally notice, but it was too late. The ground disintegrated under her as the maw of a lesser servant ate into the floor of the room. She screamed as she drew a crooked knife from her sash and dark magic erupted from her free hand. Arkk felt the servant die near instantly, but not before wrapping a tongue around the chieftain’s leg, dragging her down into the deep, *deep* pit it had been digging for the last hour.

As other servants began collapsing the corridors on the goblins, Arkk drew a sword, dropping the crystal ball.

“Now!”

Servants ate through the walls of the prisoner room, completing the tunnels just as Arkk and the others charged in.

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk shouted, frying an orc that Dakka had pointed out as one that would never betray the chieftain. Several goblins fell to lower-powered bolts as others rushed into the room.

The captive humans were screaming. They had probably been screaming ever since the orcs had started advancing on them, but that didn’t change *now*.

A cloud of dust billowed out from the collapsed corridor, but it brought with it a large horde of goblins that had managed to get out of the way of the falling ceiling.

They were intercepted, along with the surprised orcs, by Vezta’s group. Two orcs, a few humans, an elf, and a servant charged into the barrow, attacking anything that looked like a threat. Dakka rushed forward as well, running after her two friends to try to get them to give up… or else to be the one to grant them a warrior’s death. Her words.

The rest of the villagers behind Arkk weren’t here to fight. They had weapons, but their task was the prisoners. Both humans and orcs. John helped the leather-clad mercenary to his feet while Jorgen hauled the man in the wealthy clothing over his shoulder.

Arkk himself headed to the orcs along with Hurtt and the village blacksmith, Irving. The two largest non-orcs among their group. Larry followed as well. Not a fighter, but the hope was that a familiar face would convince the captive orcs to move a little faster.

A few lightning bolts sent after stray goblins were more for a display of strength than killing them. Vezta certainly needed no help. Fingers still crackling, he held his hand out to the orc in front of the group of prisoners, which caused a wince, but the orc set his jaw in defiance.

Arkk twisted his wrist, now holding his palm out as if to help the orc to its feet. “Do you want to get out of here?”

“It’s okay,” Larry said, sweating profusely as Hurtt slammed his weapon down on another goblin. “He hired us. Said he’d keep the humans from hurting us if we help take down the chief.” He paused, then glanced to Arkk. “Uh… Right?”

Arkk glanced aside, speaking in a flat tone. “Yes, Larry. That’s—”

A cry had him whirling around.

Ilya, back near the tunnel entrance trying to shoot arrows from afar, cried out as a goblin crawling along the wall pounced on her back. The goblin’s weapon was more a rusted slat of metal than a proper knife, but it was still sharp enough to cut as it flailed its little arms around. Blood spurted from Ilya’s face just below her eye before the goblin rammed the blade into her side.

Arkk didn’t even get a chance to cast a lightning spell before a crossbow bolt appeared between the goblin’s eyes.

His eyes traced the path of the bolt in a flash, noting Olatt’an already whirling to use the blade fixed to the end of his crossbow against one of the larger orcs. He slammed the butt of the weapon into the larger orc’s face before the blade sliced open his neck.

“*Electro Deus*.”

Six other goblins that had been clinging to the walls fell to the ground in smoking, twitching piles of limbs. The last one hit looked like it was about to get back up, only for a thick tendril to sprout from the floor and crush it against the wall.

Ilya, teeth clenched, had her hand pressed against her side, pinning the rusty blade in place as blood dripped from her fingers.

Arkk wanted to run over to her. She was alone, separated by the distance she had been trying to use to her advantage.

John made it to her first. With the battered mercenary already leaning on him for support, John scooped up Ilya into his arms and started carrying her out through the tunnels. The Abbess was outside. She could do more for Ilya than Arkk could.

“The Throatripper joined you?”

Arkk whirled back to the prisoners he had *almost* forgotten about. Something in his expression must have betrayed his anger; the entire group flinched backward as he faced them.

“Olatt’an,” Larry whispered, answering the question before Arkk had a chance to ask it.

Throatripper sounded far more vicious than Larry’s epithet, especially knowing that Larry’s was his profession. He wondered what kind of history Olatt’an might have behind him to garner that. Whichever of the prisoners had mentioned it had done so in reverence, not scorn. He probably had quite the body count. Then again, that was the man who had just saved Ilya from further injury entirely on reflex while engaged in his own battle.

“Are you coming or not?” Arkk said, deciding not to address it to anyone at the moment, prisoner or even himself.

The orcs seemed far less hesitant now, nodding near instantly.

Arkk turned away, unleashing a bolt of lightning over Vezta’s shoulder. She probably had been aware of the orc coming at her from behind, but it didn’t look like she had been moving to handle it.

The battle was dying out. With the corridors collapsed, the enemy couldn’t reinforce their numbers.  Were it not for the goblins, both those in the room and those that had survived the collapse, the twelve orcs would probably have fallen long ago simply due to the villagers having superior numbers.

Dakka had blood on her axe. The woman she had pointed out earlier was at her side, but not the other one. She had blood dripping from under the leather armor she wore, leaking from a gash around her waist. Not that she looked to care. She wasn’t even hunched over.

The captive humans were gone, as were those who had been assigned to escort them out. Larry, Hurtt, and Irving were leading the captive orcs out. One enemy orc had thrown his weapon to the floor, keeping his arms in the air in the universal signal for surrender.

The rest were dead. Rekk’ar lifted his blade from the punctured skull of the last one who had been fighting.

Arkk couldn’t help but grimace as he noted that their side had not survived entirely intact despite surprise, numbers, and Vezta. Ken, the village brewer, was on the ground. A blade had bit into his neck, leaving him partially decapitated. The Abbess couldn’t cure death. Several others were sporting wounds that ranged from scrapes and cuts to deep gouges, especially in the arms. Vezta was treating the worst injury in much the same way as she had treated Arkk after a goblin gnawed on his arm. The village shoemaker, Benji, was missing his left arm below the shoulder. Vezta had his stump wrapped in her tar-like body.

Clenching his teeth, Arkk gnawed on his lip. He should have done more. He *could* have done more. The plan had been made with him going to the captive orcs in the hopes of keeping them from attacking their backs if they decided to stick with their kin. He had expected more of the orcs to switch sides after what Rekk’ar and Dakka had said. But only two had, the one who had thrown down his weapon and the woman at Dakka’s side.

And the night wasn’t done yet. They needed to get back to the Abbess. They had left her a few villagers—the teenagers and one other—as guards, hoping that everyone else would rejoin her before anything happened. The orcs and goblins at the entrance would surely have noticed the collapse and while they might spend a few minutes investigating there, they would eventually make their way around.

Then there were the orcs in the barracks. With the corridors collapsed, they would be trapped. Arkk had half a mind to leave them there after this.

But he was already forming a plan for them. Without captives in their room, Arkk had no reason to enter. A lesser servant could eat a small hole into the side of the barrow, forcing them to *crawl* out if they wanted to ever leave. They could be captured one by one from there.

That still left the chieftain. Arkk was *hoping* she had fallen to her death—the servant had dug quite a massive pit—but he wasn’t going to *count* on it. If she lived or escaped, she would certainly try again.

The chieftain was now the priority.

Teeth clenched together, he led the group out of the barrows, back to the field where Vezta and the Abbess could tend to the wounded before they had to continue.

## 12 - The Chieftain


“She’s still down there. I can see movement.”

“It’s too dark to make anything out. Did she bury the glowstone knowing we were watching or did they get buried in the rubble?”

“Can she summon the demon without sacrifices?”

“Don’t ask me how it works, *human*. You’re the spellcaster here.”

“Does she have sacrifices?”

“We saved the other humans.”

“What if some goblins fell in with her, could she use those?”

Arkk stared into the crystal ball, trying to glean *anything* from the dark orb. Vezta stood to his side while Olatt’an, Rekk’ar, John, and Hurtt peered into the ball. Ilya sat on the ground not far away, refusing to stay put near the Abbess despite her injury.

The wounded were laid out on the grassy field, recovering. Those who could still carry weapons, orc and human alike, stood guard, watching for any stray goblins or orcs. Those guarding the entrance had already found them, though they couldn’t be counted among the living anymore. Arkk had not dug into the barracks yet. If those inside knew their chieftain was dead, they would be far more willing to surrender without a fight.

“Not too keen on getting close to her magic,” Olatt’an said, speaking as if he were discussing nothing more interesting than the weather. “Seen it do some nasty stuff to those who cross her.”

“Can we just leave her there?” Hurtt said. “She can’t escape, right?”

Arkk shook his head. Vezta would have been able to escape with her teleportation circles. He didn’t know if the chieftain knew any magic like that—he thought she would have used it by now—but it was too great a risk. Even if she couldn’t do *that*, who knew what else her magic was capable of.

“Drop the barrows on her,” Rekk’ar said, spitting on the ground. “Bury her alive. A warrior’s death is too good for the likes of her.”

“Will that kill her?” Arkk said. He could do it. Two of his lesser servants had died in the tunnel collapse, but he could summon more if the remainder didn’t suffice. “Quickly, I mean. I’m not going to take any chances. She dies tonight. If she escapes, this will only have enraged her even more. She’ll flee and summon another demon another day. One that we might not have the fortune of knowing about in advance.”

A moment of morbid silence followed Arkk’s words. The villagers paled at the mention of another summoning and the orcs didn’t comment on the likelihood of her survival. With the powers she learned from that book on her hip, Arkk guessed that they genuinely had no idea.

“I could stand at the top of the pit and throw lightning down it until she stops moving, but I’m sure she can toss magic back up…” Arkk glanced over to Vezta. “I don’t suppose we can carry out your former master’s final orders and get some help that way,” he said, vaguely. He didn’t exactly want everyone present to know about the [HEART] or anything to do with it if he couldn’t help it.

Vezta, unfortunately, shook her head. “Not unless you’ve dug up a magical researcher without my knowledge. I would suggest we recruit the chieftain but one who resorts to demon summoning is hardly an ally *I* would take comfort in having at my side.”

Nodding his head in definite agreement, Arkk asked, “Any other ideas?”

“I could drop down there myself and tear her apart.”

“Could you survive her magic?”

“I have survived a lot in my time,” Vezta said with a wan smile.

“But could you survive her magic?” Arkk asked again, not willing to let her skirt around the question.

She just shrugged. “Unsure.”

“A bomb,” Rekk’ar said. “Black powder. Toss that down and *boom*.”

“Where are we going to get a bomb from?” Hurtt asked with a sneer. “We’re a farming village, not an outpost for the Duke’s army.”

Rekk’ar bared his teeth in response, flashing his tusks. Hurtt, to his credit, didn’t back away, though he did look back to the crystal ball with a contemplative look on his face.

“Could *we* get a bomb?” Arkk asked Vezta.

“I’m sure we could *acquire* the materials, but without a skilled craftsman to put it together, I imagine we will face disaster.”

“Does *anyone* know how to make a bomb?” Arkk asked, addressing the others. He knew none of the villagers would.

Unfortunately, his two hopes glanced at each other. Olatt’an and Rekk’ar shrugged their shoulders, not saying anything as they glanced back at him. If any of the surviving orcs knew, they weren’t saying.

Arkk scowled, looking back to the crystal ball. He wasn’t sure why. The image in the glass was just darkness. He started trying to think of all he knew, which was distressingly little. Lightning, possession—which wasn’t something to be used on enemies, according to Vezta—and a smattering of rituals. Most of which didn’t…

Arkk blinked, then let out a small chuckle. “Wait, *I* can make a bomb.”

Ilya glanced up, scrutinizing Arkk. “Since when could you…” She trailed off, frowning. The frown quickly turned into a wide grin as her eyes widened. “You’re going to explode her.”

“I’m going to explode her.” He paused, looking at Vezta. “I haven’t exploded a spell since… *then*, but I haven’t really tried. I feel more in control of my magic, but that just means I should be able to let go of that control for *this*. Right?”

“Her blood,” Ilya said. “She was using it on the altar.”

“Perfect,” Arkk said, jumping to his feet. One of the lesser servants was already squirming over toward the barrows, ready to dig through to the room where the altar had been.

While the servant started digging, Arkk started ripping grass out of a large patch of ground. He wasn’t sure if the grass would interfere but definitely didn’t want to mess this up. Or rather, he did want to mess it up, but in a very specific sort of way. Tearing up the grass wasn’t easy. There was too much, and it was all too small.

Vezta saved him, gently moving him aside before a tendril swept across the ground. It left a thin smear of oil on the ground that *ate* the grass before quickly dissolving into nothingness, leaving dirt behind. She gave him a nod of her head before stepping aside, hands clasped together in front of her navel.

Arkk wasted no time, scrawling the tracking ritual into the cleared ground.

By the time he finished, the lesser servant had accomplished its task.

Vezta and Rekk’ar accompanied him into the newly dug tunnel, just in case there were still goblins clinging to the walls or if the chieftain had a surprise up her sleeve. However, they found nothing.

The altar was there, lit by a bowl of glowing stones in one corner. Arkk, having grabbed a leaf outside, smeared it through the still-damp blood on the surface of the heavy stone altar. What had to have been hours of work drawing out the intricate ritual were ruined in a second. Having what he needed, he turned to go.

“That’s it?” Rekk’ar said with a bit of a snort-like scoff.

“That’s it.”

Rekk’ar snorted again before grasping the side of the altar. Muscles bulging, he pushed. A bit of a creaking groan in the unstable ground had Arkk taking a few steps back down the tunnel, but Vezta stepped forward to assist. She grasped the altar with a myriad of tentacles and flipped it into the deep pit.

Screaming echoed out. Anger, not pain, unfortunately.

Rekk’ar looked to Arkk and shrugged. “Was hoping it would crush her. Now hoping it screwed up whatever she was surely planning down there.”

“If nothing else,” Vezta said, tendrils disappearing under her dress, “the glowstones may provide insight into her actions.”

“Well, shouldn’t be necessary now,” Arkk said, clutching the leaf tight.

He hurried back out of the barrow and rushed over to the ritual he had scrawled into the ground. Setting the leaf in the triangle, Arkk took up his position opposite from it. Just as he had done with tracking the stag, he poured just a little magic into the circle.

Ethereal silhouettes formed in his vision. He ignored the bush he had plucked the leaf from and focused downward. The orc chieftain glowed, appearing *through* the ground. She was working on something down there. From her movements, Arkk guessed that it was a ritual circle carved into the walls.

Not knowing what it did and *definitely* not wanting to find out, Arkk started to focus more magic into the spell. With the stag, the spell had started to fade and he had panicked, flooding it with magic in an attempt to keep the spell going.

Here and now, he opened the floodgates to their fullest *intentionally*.

The bush started to sparkle and crack first. Smoke drifted from its withering twigs. But Arkk’s eyes were on the chieftain down below.

She noticed something was wrong. Her scrawling stopped and she stared at her hands. That lasted a mere moment before she started panicking. Arkk couldn’t tell exactly what she was doing, but it didn’t matter.

Wincing, snapping his head back reflexively, Arkk grimaced at the sight.

He could see the chieftain’s blood, having used blood in his tracking spell. It was *everywhere*. The pit had a fresh coating all around its bottom. The largest mass of blood, presumably the remains of the chieftain, barely looked humanoid anymore. Just a smattering of ruined meat.

A cheer from behind him drew his attention to a whole crowd that had gathered around the crystal ball. A few of them, especially the villagers, looked like they were going to be sick. Hurtt, however, let out a loud whoop and promptly slammed his fist into Jorgen’s shoulder. The orcs were a bit more subdued in their reactions, though Arkk did not miss a glance exchanged between Olatt’an and Rekk’ar. The former nodded at the latter, a barely perceptible dip of his head.

“Vezta,” Arkk said, silencing the celebration with that single word alone. “Can you get me down there?”

“You wish to descend into *that*?” she asked, pointing a slender finger that dripped with a little tar toward the crystal ball. “Would you like to look first and reconsider? She appears to have suffered injuries *quite* incompatible with continued life.”

“I want to make *sure*.”

“It looks pretty sure to me,” John mumbled, averting his eyes from the crystal ball.

Vezta ignored him. “Very well,” she said, not offering any other argument as she walked to Arkk.

Together, they returned to the barrows. Vezta split apart into a mass of tentacles, losing her human guise from the waist down. Arkk raised an eyebrow but didn’t otherwise protest as she wrapped one tendril around his waist and under his arms while her arms wrapped around his shoulders, securing him in a harness made from herself.

The rest of the tendrils jammed into the rock walls of the pit. Using them as anchors, she started descending, jamming new tendrils into the walls as they went.

Arkk had experienced many strange things in the past several days, but this was probably the strangest. Still, he didn’t complain. Vezta was only doing as he asked.

The scent of viscera stung Arkk’s nose as they descended. He tried to breathe through his mouth alone, but it didn’t quite get rid of the pungent scent. It only made him *taste* a metallic note in the air.

He tried not to think about it.

He and Vezta soon reached the bottom. She kept hold of him, making sure that he stayed well above the pool of blood that had gathered at the bottom of the pit. The glowstones were coated in blood, making the light they put off an unpleasant, violent red color. It probably made the entire pit look worse than it was, but not by much.

Arkk… couldn’t take his eyes off the… thing. If someone had told him that it was an orc a few minutes ago and he hadn’t known better, he wouldn’t have believed them. There was absolutely no skin left anywhere that had been exposed to air. He could see flaps of green flesh clinging to the interior of the cowl, which had also been thrown off the chieftain’s head. It had no eyes. No… anything. Bone. It had bone. The skull looked like something had tried to escape from inside it.

Arkk couldn’t help it. He vomited. Vezta kept hold of him, even going so far as to lightly pat his back.

“I did try to warn you,” she said, voice gentle.

“Yeah,” Arkk said, wiping the corner of his lip. “I… Remind me, if I ever want to try something like this in the future, to *not*.”

“But it was so effective.”

“Too effective. There have to be better ways of dealing with an enemy in a situation like this.”

“If you insist,” Vezta said with a sigh. “Shall we return?”

“Yeah, we—” Arkk paused, eyes roaming down the body of the orc chieftain. “Wait. Lower me, just a bit.”

“Lower?”

Though she questioned him, Vezta did as he asked. Arkk reached out, brushing aside now loose chains. The black book the chieftain had was, improbably, still black. It had managed to avoid the coating of blood that covered everything else. Arkk wasn’t sure if it was that its owner was dead or simply that he could easily grasp it, but the moment he touched it, he felt the [HEART] acknowledge it as his property.

The book vanished in a flash, reappearing on a shelf in his library for later perusal.

“*Master*,” Vezta said, her gentle tone absent from her now harsh voice. “I hope you are not planning something unbecoming of a Keeper of the [HEART] of Fortress Al-Mir.”

“I’m not going to summon a demon, Vezta,” Arkk said with a small sigh. “But if someone else has a similar book or similar magic, I want to know what they can do.”

Vezta hummed. Hugging him tighter, she somehow managed to turn Arkk around to face her. She didn’t say anything. She just stared into his eyes with her luminous golden suns.

“I promise,” Arkk said.

“Good.” Vezta moved her head closer, dropping her chin on his shoulder. She didn’t speak anything more, choosing to remain quiet aside from her tendrils puncturing the rock as they ascended the pit. When they finally reached the top, it felt like there was some reluctance in releasing him.

There was still much to do. The other orcs in the barracks needed to be dealt with. The wounded still needed tending. He needed to figure out what to do with the orcs they had rescued.

Their dead needed to be buried.

And yet, despite that, Arkk felt like a pressure had been removed from his back. The possibility of a demon appearing was no more. They could take their time. Do things carefully. 

Arkk let out a soft sigh, wondering how an amateur hunter had wound up in this position.

## 13 - Aftermath of the Barrows


Ilya grasped at her side, teeth clenched tight. The ointment that Abbess Keena had slathered onto her wound helped to numb the pain, but only while sitting still. She tried not to move too much, but at the same time, she didn’t want to *appear* injured.

The orc, Dakka, sported a similar wound. A deep gash right in her side nearly twice as long as Ilya’s wound. *She* wasn’t grimacing and limping around. The Abbess hadn’t even tended to the orc. Yet Dakka carried around her ridiculous shield riddled with spikes that had to increase its weight by an absurd amount and her battle axe that looked like it could cleave a tree in two with a single swing. Neither hampered her movements in the slightest.

Orcs had always been a hardy sort. Ilya wasn’t envious, but she still didn’t want to *lose*.

“So what now?”

Ilya’s ears twitched as she picked out the gruff voice of the burly orc leader, Rekk’ar. He wasn’t speaking at full volume, instead having dropped to something akin to a whisper. She looked around carefully, not wanting to get picked out as an eavesdropper.

Arkk was ensuring the orcs who were emerging one by one from the barrows were disarmed and suitably cowed. Several of the villagers were helping, along with the healthier four of the six orcs who had been captive. Those orcs had already turned on their fellows before Arkk’s arrival and needed little convincing to keep those who had beaten and imprisoned them in line.

Dakka stood not far behind Arkk, snarling at the occasional orc while looking at others with pity in her eyes.

But Ilya’s eyes focused on Rekk’ar and Olatt’an. They were both nearby as well, though standing off a few paces. Close enough to ostensibly support Arkk, but far enough as to carry on a conversation in private.

Narrowing her eyes in suspicion, Ilya looked away. Her gaze focused on the next orc crawling out of the low tunnel, but her ears focused on the two behind her.

“What now?” Olatt’an said, voice even quieter than Rekk’ar’s. “We made an agreement.”

“The human? You can’t intend to carry through.”

“And what would you do, Rekk? Steal off into the night? Find another horde to join, raiding villages until the Duke’s men are finally roused from their sloth? You’ll die like a dog, pathetic and whimpering.”

Rekk’ar snarled at the older orc, loud enough to draw attention from more than just Ilya. The two fell silent. Rekk’ar glared at anyone who dared look in their direction, including Ilya when she chanced a glance. When they finally started talking again, Ilya had to strain to hear their hushed voices.

“The winds are changing. The *stars* are changing. In times like these, best to be on the side of change, wouldn’t you agree?”

“The human? He’s a boy. A peasant.”

“With the company he keeps, do you believe that? All great men and women, whether orc, human, or any other species, began their lives as boys and girls. They must begin somewhere.”

“He didn’t even *fight*. The coward hid behind us. Did the chieftain ripping your teeth out also rip your spine out?”

Ilya tensed, fingers curling tight around her bow. *Toothless*, she knew, was an insult and slur among orcs. The kind of insult that started fights to the death.

Yet, to her surprise, the old orc just let out a low chuckle. “You didn’t see his eyes, did you?”

“Eyes?”

“When his woman cried out.”

Ilya bristled. They were talking about her. “His *woman*?” she grumbled under her breath. She shot a glare at Arkk on reflex, though with his back turned, he would never know it.

“Red,” Olatt’an said after a short moment. “Glowing red. Could you not feel the charge in the air at that moment?”

Ilya raised an eyebrow, glare on Arkk turning to a curious examination. Arkk had blue eyes. Bright blue eyes. It would be hard to mistake them for red. Unless, of course, orcs saw color differently than she did. Ilya honestly didn’t know.

And glowing?

“I was a bit caught up in the fight,” Rekk’ar said, murmuring.

“There is a lecture on awareness here, but I’ll spare you for the moment,” Olatt’an said with a friendly laugh. His tone sobered again as he said, “Regardless of your thoughts, my interest has been piqued. If he turns out to be nothing, I’ll leave, but for now, I wish to see his change for myself.” He shrugged. “I can think of far worse, less honorable fates than serving a human boy in any case. Serving our former chieftain, for one.”

“Good riddance. That is one thing I will give the boy. Watching her squirm in her final moments was the most satisfying experience I had with her.”

“If you decide to leave, that is your choice. Just know you’ll get no support from me.”

A grumble from Rekk’ar ended the conversation. The two split apart after, with Olatt’an simply walking around the captured orcs while Rekk’ar went to yell at one that might have been looking too uppity for his liking.

Ilya remained where she was, eyes still following Arkk. He looked tired. Exhausted. Even more so than after the battle in the village. Ilya could only imagine that his lethargy came from Ken’s death, Benji’s arm, and the various other injuries the villagers had sustained. Ken’s death stung Ilya as well. He had always been a nice guy, even if his beer was terrible.

But he hadn’t died under Ilya’s command. He hadn’t died while following Ilya’s plan.

It was too much to hope that everyone would have survived a battle like that. Arkk would beat himself up over it anyway.

Arkk’s eyes, his *blue* eyes, met with Ilya’s for a moment. He gave her a smile. Not exactly a joyous smile, but a smile nonetheless. Straightening his back, he seemed to recharge just a bit before turning back to the disarmed orcs. Ilya wasn’t sure if he was planning on hiring them as well.

She wasn’t sure how she felt about that. The four who had come to them with the warning about their chieftain were understandable. The six captives as well. Even the two who had surrendered in battle, maybe. But there were another fifteen who had crawled out from the other side of the barrows. They were *all* murderers, but at least the others had turned on their demon-summoning chieftain.

Ilya wanted to toss them to the Duke’s men for trial. They would probably end up executed, but that was the consequence of raiding villages.

Leaning back, gripping her side again as the movement shot pain through her wound, Ilya stared at the night sky. A million tiny lights stared back as she considered the orc’s words. The winds and stars changing? She didn’t see anything different.

With a shake of her head, she steadied herself. She would have to warn Arkk of the orcs and their possible desertion. And, at the same time, she would have to keep a closer watch on Arkk.

And Arkk’s eyes.

***

“No! Hale!”

Hale jolted back at the sudden shout. She almost tipped her chair over. Only the wild swinging of her arms kept her stable long enough to kick her foot into the bottom of the desk, knocking her back forward.

Arkk was back. Under other circumstances, she might have run up to him, demanding to know what happened and why he had left her alone for so long. The obvious anger on his tired face locked her into her seat.

The book she had been reading disappeared from the desk in front of her, reappearing in Arkk’s hand. He stared down at its black and red cover for a long moment, looking angrier with the book than he was with her. *Thankfully*. The book disappeared from between his fingers after a moment. She didn’t miss it reappearing on a much higher shelf than she had found it on but did her best to keep her eyes on Arkk.

“You can’t be reading books like that,” he said, voice hard and angry.

“I… I’m sorry. I didn’t know. It just appeared and—”

“I know,” Arkk said, taking a breath and closing his eyes. “I’m sorry. I forgot you were here.”

“You forgot?” Hale glared. Arkk didn’t look quite so upset, so she felt like she could get away with a little anger of her own. “Where were you? It’s been *days*. You just left me here? And that thing wouldn’t even let me leave!” Hale said, pointing to the little monster that was guarding the door.

“It hasn’t even been one day,” Arkk said with a sigh. He locked eyes with Hale. “I need you to understand, that was not a good book. Don’t do *anything* you learned from it, okay?”

Hale crossed her arms, frowning. “I couldn’t read most of the words,” she mumbled.

“What was that?”

“I was just looking at the drawings!” she snapped. John had taught her some words, but not most of the ones in that book. Instead, she had been looking at all the drawings. There had been a lot of skulls, for some reason. Skulls and circles like the one Arkk popped out of just a moment ago. And maybe directions for moving her hand in a specific way while casting spells. “What happened with the orcs?” she asked, sitting up.

“Oh, well…” Arkk trailed off, glancing back to the magic circle just as it flashed with a faint white light.

A hulking green-skinned man stood in the middle of the circle. He had a flat nose and black hair that ran around his face and chin. Yellow eyes locked on Hale. As he stared, he curled his bottom lip away from two long tusks.

Hale jumped out of her seat, hiding behind Arkk.

“It’s okay,” he said quickly, patting her on the head. “This is Rekk’ar. He helped fight the bad orcs.”

“Bad orcs?”

“You *employ* children?” the orc said, voice like the lumberyard saw.

“No. And step out of there,” Arkk said, waving his hand away from the magic circle. “I don’t know what happens if someone tries to come through while someone else is standing inside. I would really rather not find out.”

Grumpy. That was how Hale would describe the orc’s movements. The way he stormed across the floor, crossed his arms, and even how his eyes looked over the empty shelves of the library. He was grumpy about it all. Not quite angry but he didn’t want to be here.

“Empty place.”

“It’s a work in progress.”

“Mhmm…”

Arkk didn’t speak with any kindness in his tone either. The two didn’t exactly glare at each other, but Hale doubted they were as friendly as Arkk had tried to make it sound.

The magic circle flashed again a moment later and another orc appeared. This one was much older, with brown-tan skin rather than bright green. Although he looked mildly surprised to see Hale, he didn’t sneer or growl at her. He just looked at her for a moment before examining the rest of the room. When he finished, he offered Arkk a polite nod of his head.

Hale liked this orc much better than the other one.

“Well,” Arkk said, shifting. “Welcome to Fortress Al-Mir. Most of the place is empty, but Vezta drew up some schematics for rooms she thought you and your kin would need.”

“Where are we?” the green orc asked.

“The middle of the Cursed Forest.”

“The Deadlands?”

Arkk shrugged. “The people of Langleey call it the Cursed Forest.”

“We’re in the *Cursed Forest*?” Hale gasped. “We can’t be there!”

Arkk glanced down, running a hand through her hair. “Right. We should send you back to the village.”

“No! I can be good.”

Rolling his eyes, Arkk shook his head. “Fine. When I go back, you’re going back with me. Understand?”

“Okay.” Hale didn’t want to be left behind with orcs anyway.

“Come,” Arkk said to the orcs. “I’ll show you where you’re staying. We’ll discuss further arrangements and duties later.”

“Duties?” Green-skin said with a growl as they walked down a stone corridor. “You expect us to work?”

Hale was more focused on her surroundings than on the orcs now. Every few steps, a small blue-purple gemstone glowed on the floor. They passed some huge doors built into the walls, each of which opened for the tan-skinned orc as he peered inside.

“I did hire you. I’m fully prepared to continue paying you a regular allotment.”

“And where would we spend our pay?”

“I…” Arkk trailed off. He clearly hadn’t thought about it.

The tan orc saved him from having to answer. “Every room we’ve passed has been empty. Not much here, is there?”

“As I said, it is a work in progress,” Arkk said, stopping at a door. Hale wasn’t sure what made this room different from the last. It was just as empty as all of them, but he stepped inside. “Wait here,” he said, motioning for them to stop just inside the door.

A pile of gold coins appeared at his feet from nothing. Hale’s eyes bulged as she stared. John occasionally got work for the merchants, mercenaries, and adventurers that passed through town. Often to make new arrows or, occasionally, to repair broken parts of carts and wagons. They usually paid in small silver coins. Hale had only seen a gold coin *once* before, and John hadn’t wanted it, saying it was too much for the job.

Arkk stood over an ankle-high *pile* of gold coins.

The coins didn’t stay in place for long, however.

The room changed. Instead of the gray tiles patterned with points and those blue gemstones, smooth dark tiles rippled into place within the room. The bright yellow flames of the torches on the walls snuffed out. In their place, more glowing stones formed in fancy star-like patterns. They weren’t as bright as the torches but combined with the dark tiles, it made the atmosphere a lot cozier.

“You turned an empty room into an empty room,” the green orc said with a disgruntled snort.

“Well, if Vezta was right, you should—”

The tan orc interrupted Arkk, stepping into the room. “There is magic here.” After looking around the room with narrowed eyes, his gaze settled on the corner nearest to the door. He walked over and held out a hand.

A thick wooden pole sprouted up from the dark tiles a short distance from the wall. Several smaller poles emerged nearby, arrayed around the large pole. Crossbeams locked into place near the tops, joining all the poles together. Sheets of leather, stitched together like they had come from a number of different animals, unfurled from the crossbeams, forming an upright, circular tent. The orc shoved aside the front-most section of leather, the only piece that wasn’t fastened to the upright poles.

A bed sat against one wall of the tent. Fur rugs covered most of the floor, though a small pit dug a short distance into the ground burned as a small campfire. The flames had a little pewter pot resting on long legs. Something bubbled inside. Taking a deep breath of the air, Hale felt her mouth start to water. Meat and potatoes in a thick brown gravy.

The orc hung his crossbow from a hook attached to the center pillar. He undid some of his armor as well, hanging up a heavy armguard that was probably just there to keep the sharp blade on the crossbow from cutting into his arm. “This,” he said, reemerging from the tent, “will suffice.”

“How did you do that?” the green-skinned orc growled.

Arkk looked like he wanted to know too. Naturally, Hale listened close.

“I just did what felt natural.”

Grumbling under his breath, the green-skinned orc moved up to the spot next to the large tent and held out his hand. He seemed to struggle a lot more but did get something to pop up from the ground.

It wasn’t as fancy as the large, circular tent. The green-skinned orc managed to make a triangular tent with sloped leather walls. It did have a bed inside, but was much shorter than the circular tent and lacked the little campfire.

Ignoring the complaints from the orc about the state of his dwelling in comparison to the tan-skinned orc, Hale hurried over to a different side of the room and held out her hand.

No matter how much she tried to ‘do what felt natural,’ she didn’t manage to get anything to pop up out of the ground before Arkk herded her back to the village.

She scowled the entire time.

***

Dakka stalked through the halls of Fortress Al-Mir, armor clinking and clanking with each step. Some of the others had taken to leaving their gear behind in their quarters. Not Dakka. Her shield hung from the back of her armor and her axe was looped into a rope strung around her waist. She had an image to maintain and could not afford to be seen as anything less than a ferocious warrior.

She had been the runt of the group for long enough.

Her position of power wasn’t anything formal, unfortunately. In fact, if she hadn’t had the good fortune of being put on watch with Rekk’ar and Olatt’an the night they slipped away from the barrows, she likely would have been a nobody here, assuming she had survived at all. Just another face among the horde. As it was, she wasn’t consulted often.

Rekk’ar had taken up the position of leader for their horde, working under Arkk. They butted heads but had yet to come to blows. For the first few days, Dakka had thought that Rekk’ar would challenge Arkk for leadership, but that had yet to come to pass. Arkk had powerful magic and… well… Vezta wasn’t someone anyone wanted to cross.

Olatt’an helped keep things calm as well. Arkk tended to go to Olatt’an next. As he should. If Arkk knew anything about orcs, he would have ignored Rekk’ar entirely. The Ripthroat, though his teeth had been stolen by the old chieftain, still managed to command respect.

Arkk came to Dakka third. It wasn’t often, as he usually stuck with the first two when he needed to discuss living arrangements or figure out if any of the orcs were skilled blacksmiths to work forges that he had conjured up from a small pile of gold. However, Arkk came to her often enough for the others to take notice. Dakka did her best to flaunt her position as much as possible without being too overt about it. She couldn’t appear *desperate*.

Of the four that Arkk originally hired, only Larry was left out.

Not that the oaf minded.

Dakka stopped walking at a large door not far from the living quarters. A cheerful, oblivious whistle drifted out from inside, along with the sound of panicked, clucking chickens. Peering inside, she watched Larry happily wring the neck of a chicken before he started plucking the feathers, filling a large basket. Three other chickens, already plucked clean, hung from hooks above a long, bloody table.

At least he was being useful. That was more than Dakka could say about half the orcs Arkk had hired.

Dakka continued, heading toward the neighboring tavern. Every day, she made use of the training room for longer than anyone else. It worked up quite the appetite. When considering it like that, Larry was perhaps the *most* useful of all of Arkk’s hirelings.

Before she could reach the door, Dakka heard the clink and clank of armor that wasn’t her own.

Turning her head, she narrowed her eyes.

Kazz’ak was in full armor as well. What was more, he had a heavy war pick out and in his hands. His movements were not overtly hostile, but his eyes were locked on Dakka. She knew a challenge when she saw one.

Dakka wished she could say she was surprised. There were murmurs among the orcs. Following a human did not resonate well with some of them. She didn’t think that Kazz’ak had been a part of that group, but when someone crawled out of the barrows squealing that they had never wanted to serve their old chieftain despite never having shown signs of hesitance, she figured they would betray just about anyone to save their lives, honor be damned.

Kazz’ak was a head taller than her with a longer reach. His war pick would puncture straight through her armor if he got a good hit in.

So, he couldn’t get a good hit in.

Dakka struck first, unleashing her axe and swinging it around in one swift strike, putting him on the defensive.

She wasn’t sure why he was after her. Maybe he wanted her position as third in command. Maybe he held some grudge that she couldn’t even recall. Maybe he blamed her for their chieftain’s downfall and was too much of a coward to challenge Rekk’ar or Olatt’an. No matter what his thinking was, it was foolhardy.

Dakka swept her axe through the air, missing his arms by a hair’s breadth. She took care to keep her swings short and swift. They might not do much damage, but the attacks she was using wouldn’t overextend her either. Dakka had no intention of taking a hit from that pick.

If Arkk had been an orc, attacking and beating her might have been a good way to gain status, but he wasn’t. Arkk was a human. Dakka hadn’t spent a lot of time around humans but doubted he would be pleased to find fighting among his employees.

Their fight wasn’t silent. It didn’t take long for someone to step out into the corridor, notice the fight, and shout for others to come. Naturally, they didn’t help. They started cheering. Egging on the fight. Calling for bets, perhaps. Dakka put them out of her mind and focused on her fight.

Would Arkk punish her for fighting? Possibly. Especially because she could open her mouth and call his attention here at any moment. But that would just make her look weak. Like she had to hide behind him, to count on him to win her battles for her.

Kazz’ak’s eyes widened as his foot bumped against the spiked decoration on the tiles.

Dakka didn’t hesitate, swinging hard to capitalize on his poor footwork.

His foot slid aside the moment she started her strike, gliding out of the way. *A feint*? His strike was already coming in.

Giving into the momentum of her swing, Dakka pivoted around her foot. The war pick slammed into the shield on her back, making her stumble a step forward. As fast as she could, she continued turning around, adjusting the angle of her axe blade to keep the edge in line with her momentum. There was a bit of resistance in her turn, but when she rounded on Kazz’ak again, she saw him staring in surprise at his own empty hands.

The pick must have gotten stuck in the shield.

The blade of her axe bit into his chest. It wasn’t as strong as a proper blow would have been, but it still sent him reeling back, blood gushing to the floor.

Dakka was about to go in to finish the job when a *force* threw her back. She backpedaled, barely managing to remain standing, and eventually stopped.

Arkk stood between her and Kazz’ak. His eyes were wide, staring at the taller orc for a moment before rounding on Dakka.

“What is going on here?” he hissed.

She had been right. He *was* angry.

Dakka lowered her axe, keeping it in her grip but showing deference to Arkk. “He thought he’d get a promotion if he killed me, sir,” she said, taking a guess at his motivations. “I handled it.”

“*What*?” Arkk’s eyes flashed, briefly turning red as he rounded on Kazz’ak.

“No! I…” He met Arkk’s eyes for just a moment before ducking his head, not meeting Arkk’s gaze. Dakka took that as a confession.

Arkk apparently did as well. “Are you alright?” he asked, looking back to Dakka.

“Not a scratch.”

Nodding, Arkk looked back to Kazz’ak. He slowly looked around, staring at the watching orcs with a deepening scowl. Eventually, he looked to Kazz’ak once more. “Congratulations, you’ve volunteered to help me test a new spell,” he said, speaking loud enough that the entire corridor heard.

They both disappeared, popping out of the corridor.

Dakka curled a lip, hoping that Arkk’s new spell was a painful one. Looking away, she turned her gaze to the orcs. “Well?” she shouted. “Who all bet on *me*?”

It took a moment. A few of the orcs started cheering. Not as many as she would have liked, but enough that at least she hadn’t just raised a fist in celebration of an awkward silence.

She took careful note of the faces most upset with her victory and filed them away for later.

Dakka wouldn’t be a runt again.

***

Pontiff Benjamin Bernardin ascended the many steps to the Grand Old Church in a slow and methodical fashion. He paused often, making sure to greet everyone he passed. It didn’t matter if they were the lowliest acolyte or initiate, a random member of the public, or the Ecclesiarch himself—not that the Ecclesiarch visited Cliff. If no one was in sight, he would take his time and read from his copy of the Holy Texts. Perhaps even taking a seat on the stairs to do so. Others, he knew, saw his movements as pious, dedicated, and humble.

In reality, Ben did not wish to enter the old church out of breath and sweating through his robes.

He was getting much too old for this. If only he could be reassigned to some other province.

The City of Cliff, the Duchy of Mystakeen’s capital city, was not so named because it had been built on wide open plains. A grand river flowed out to the ocean, offering a wonderful harbor for trade and fishing. Much of the city had been built around the harbor, down where it *was* a bit more level. However, mountains surrounded the entire settlement. One tall spire jutted out right in the middle of the harbor, connected to the rest of the city by a fine stone bridge. Some great fool from ages long past thought a church set atop the island mountain would impress all who saw it.

It did. That didn’t make it any easier to reach.

For that reason, he was all too happy to pause upon a landing of the stone stairs that had been carved into the cliff face when he heard someone calling him from behind.

“Your Holiness!”

A much younger boy took the steps three at a time. He wasn’t dressed as any member of the church but rather had fairly plain attire. Ben didn’t recognize the boy’s face, nevertheless, he smiled when he saw him, raising a hand in greeting.

“How might I be of service this fine day?”

The boy shook his head, reaching into a small satchel that hung from his shoulder. “Just a message for you, sir,” he said, holding out a small letter.

Technically, a delivery like this should go all the way to his office in the church above. Ben didn’t blame the boy for wanting to shave off half the trip by delivering it to him directly.

It was a good excuse to stop. Ben didn’t mind in the slightest. “Thank you,” he said, pulling a few silver coins from his pocket to tip the young boy. “May the Light go with you.”

The boy looked far more excited about the coins than his words. Which Ben didn’t blame him for either.

Looking down at the letter, he noted the wax seal on the front. The marking of the Abbey of the Light had been pressed in. This particular version indicated that it was sent by either a priest or an abbess. That likely meant that it had come from one of the many tiny villages strewn throughout the land. It was a bit odd that the letter was coming to him. Local religious guides would normally send messages to their bishop, rather than to him.

Curiosity piqued, Ben broke the seal and pulled out the letter.

The more he read, the more alarmed he became. An army of orcs and goblins alone almost had him rushing back down the steps to the Duke’s manor. A demon summoning by those orcs might have had him crying in alarm on the spot were the passage not prefaced with word that the situation had been handled.

The small village with a population numbering less than one hundred, most of whom were not fighters, had managed to drive off the initial attack by the orcs. Then, after hearing of an imminent demon summoning, they allied with a few orc deserters to put a swift end to the orc leader’s plot.

Ben’s relief was short-lived, unfortunately. As he read further, he found the true cause for the missive. Concern over an unknown monster that aided the villagers. It hadn’t hurt any of the villagers, yet every time this abbess looked at it, it filled her with a deep unease and dread. A feeling of impending doom struck her.

And it wasn’t just the monster. The sensation was spreading to those with whom the monster associated most.

The letter was a simple plea for guidance. How to respond to such a monster that hadn’t obviously hurt anyone, and had saved them, yet caused such feelings within the Abbess. There were questions of whether or not the Abbess was imagining the feelings since no one else seemed to notice.

Ben skimmed past the remainder of the letter before returning to the description of the monster.

Hiking up his robes in a most undignified manner, Pontiff Benjamin Bernardin ascended the steps to the Grand Old Church in a hurry. He did not greet anyone as he passed them. He did not stop at each landing to admire the view. He made haste to the church’s archives, headed straight to the back, and pulled an old and dusty manuscript from the furthest shelf.

He flipped it open and began to read.

Every word turned worry into dread.

## 14 - Harvest


An orc with deep, almost red skin shot Arkk a dark look. Pausing his scythe-swinging, Arkk glared back until the orc averted its gaze.

Several under his employ were a bit unhappy with the situation. He recognized that mutiny might be near but this was something he wasn’t willing to budge on.

Harvest wasn’t a simple thing where one day everyone woke up and decided to harvest everything all at once. These things came in waves. Several crops overlapped; beets, oats, and barley all needed to be harvested within a few weeks of each other. Corn and beans would be a few weeks later. Winter wheat and sorghum came a few weeks earlier. Barley and oat fields were by far the largest, requiring the most work and the most effort to reap.

So, he had carefully explained to the orcs that, because they attacked his village, they would be paying reparations in service. Harvesting service, specifically. Although being hired as employees through the [HEART] required payment or some kind of promised exchange, they were not being paid for this specifically. Each orc was to receive one gold coin a month with special bonuses available for special services—combat if it should become necessary, blacksmithing, and Larry got a special stipend for his services as a butcher. Arkk was forcing every orc, even the likes of Rekk’ar and Olatt’an, to help with this year’s harvest if they wanted to remain employed. They were not receiving anything extra for it.

It wouldn’t be reparations if they were being paid.

Not his most popular decision. Still, no one had said no. Not after five of the fifteen orcs from the barrows had refused to join him. Those five had been sent in chains to the nearest burg where the Duke’s men would hopefully deal with them according to the laws of the land. No one was too keen on joining them.

Arkk sighed as he went back to sweeping the scythe over the ground, cutting the stalks of the oats. Things had settled into something of a routine over the three weeks that had passed since the barrows incident. He felt like he was starting to get used to his new life as… whatever he was. Owner of a magical fortress. Leader of a bunch of orcs. He preferred the former to the latter.

Honestly, part of the reason the orcs were sweeping scythes through the field was that he just didn’t know what else to do with them. It was easy for Vezta to say that minions would come in useful, but they couldn’t just sit around in the fortress all day every day, could they? They did seem content for now, especially after he had turned one of the rooms into a big pit for brawls with room for spectators and betting, but that wouldn’t last.

Looking around the field right now, Arkk decided that farm work was *not* an option. While they were doing the work, they were not happy with it. He had snapped at a few of them earlier who looked like they were deliberately sabotaging the harvest with wild and careless swings of their scythes.

No. Farm work would end up a disaster in some way, of that Arkk had no doubt. Was there other work they might be interested in?

Aside from Larry, working the kitchens and butchery, only one had stepped forward for a specialized position. Perr’ok. He didn’t talk much but did mention that his father had forged for the Duchy toward the end of the war with the Evestani Sultanate that ended thirty years ago. He took over a smithy that Arkk had constructed within the fortress. Aside from those two, everyone else was a raider. Warriors.

As much as Arkk hated the Duke, he did not want to start a war. If warriors weren’t to go to war, then…

Mercenary work?

That seemed like an idea. Now that it was in Arkk’s head, he couldn’t help but nod to himself in satisfaction. The orcs would likely revel in the opportunity. Maybe he could even use being sent on missions as a reward for good behavior.

Arkk talked with everyone who passed through Langleey Village. Several of those people were mercenaries. There was always work to be done. Sometimes it was protecting a merchant as they carried valuable goods between locales, hunting down criminals, taking out groups of highwaymen accosting travelers, and plenty of other *martial* matters.

Arkk didn’t need money with that gold mine still filling his coffers, so perhaps some could go to the village? Maybe even other villages, again as reparations.

As for the rest, the orcs needed some funds to bet on their fight clubs. A little income to gamble away would probably make morale soar.

Looking up from his work, Arkk found Rekk’ar and Olatt’an not far away. Rekk’ar looked as if the ground itself had been stringing insult after insult at him, but Olatt’an had a relatively soft expression on his face as he carefully swung his scythe through the stalks of oats. The older orc was a mystery to Arkk. For someone the others all spoke of in hushed tones, someone who others called the Ripthroat, he was… surprisingly mellow. Given that he was by far the oldest orc around and Arkk lacked a real frame of reference for orc culture—or the culture of these raiders—Arkk had to wonder if aging had calmed a more violent youth.

Or if he was just good at hiding it.

Before Arkk could head over to ask their opinion on his new idea, he spotted something beyond them.

A carriage drawn by a pair of horses with a man in a black cap seated at the reins barreled up the path toward the village. It wasn’t just any carriage either. The glossy walls gleamed with a shiny black lacquer and it had *glass* windows. As it turned along the path leading past the fields, he spotted the blue and white striped shield that was typically used by official representatives of Duke Levi Woldair and the Duchy as a whole.

The only representative that passed through these parts was the taxman.

Setting his scythe down, Arkk started across the field. He did not rush after the carriage immediately. Instead, he headed toward the adjacent barley field. Most of the villagers stuck to this field, not exactly keen on being near a bunch of angry orcs. More importantly, Ilya worked in the barley fields.

He spotted her quickly. The large straw hat couldn’t hide her long silver hair. She had her head down, back to the path. Had she not seen the carriage?

“Ilya!”

She glanced back, keeping her head down. Her silver eyes, wide with alarm, met his beneath the straw hat. Carefully looking around, eyes drifting toward the path, she pressed her lips together. In a hurry, she tucked her long silver hair down the back of her shirt before readjusting her hat to cover as much of her hair as possible. As soon as that was done, she tucked her long ears up into the hat.

“They’re *weeks* early,” she hissed as Arkk ran up.

“No large carts following them,” Arkk said, looking back down the path. “They aren’t going to take any tax in that small carriage. And it was so nice looking too. Never had something like that visit before.”

“I don’t like it,” she said, pulling her hat down tighter. “Something is different and I doubt it is for the better.”

The carriage had disappeared behind the terrain and a few buildings for a few moments but quickly came back into sight as it climbed the slight incline of the path leading to the plaza. “I’m going to find out what they’re here for. Find Hale. She can get you to the fortress if necessary.”

“Hale?” Ilya’s silver eyes darted around. “Where is Vezta?”

“Back at the fortress, working on a… special project for me.”

In her worry over their visitors, Ilya didn’t question what that project was. She simply nodded her head. Arkk still hadn’t told her about Vezta’s goal. He kept meaning to, but how did one bring up undoing the *Calamity*? He had time to figure it out.

“What about the orcs?”

Arkk bit his lip. “They almost certainly saw the orcs already. It would be too suspicious if they just disappeared now. If we convince them that the orcs were just a traveling troupe assisting with harvest instead of where they came from…” His eyes widened as he realized just who the people in that carriage were most likely to speak with first. “I need to get up there and stop the Baron from opening his big mouth.”

Arkk took off without another word.

He wished he could simply teleport up to the village proper. Within Fortress Al-Mir, Arkk could move anywhere at will. He could also move himself and any of his employees to the fortress. However, the village was not part of his territory. He couldn’t teleport to it, only from it. The lesser servants had to claim territory for the [HEART] and, with the relatively large distance between the fortress and the village, Arkk had decided to have them focus on the gold mine rather than spend the time slowly crawling toward the village. The teleportation circle worked well enough.

The teleportation circle didn’t help now. It could only go from a designated point to a designated point. He couldn’t even draw one. Vezta tried to explain how to select the destination location but it had gone over Arkk’s head.

It took a few minutes to run up the path. Because of that, he wasn’t surprised in the slightest to find the carriage deserted save for the coachman, who was now fanning his face with his large hat. Ignoring him for the moment, Arkk crossed the large garden before Baron Gert’s manor and opened the door without bothering to knock.

Voices were coming from a sitting room just off the entryway. Arkk *meant* to listen in for a moment before barging right into the conversation. An extremely tall man with thick sideburns and thin glasses stood just aside the open doorway, fiddling with some whittled decoration the Baron had on a shelf. He looked surprised for a moment but put on a smile.

“Ah,” he said, “it seems we have a visitor.”

“Visitor?” the Baron said, stepping into view. As soon as he saw who was there, he started beaming. “Arkk! I was just telling them! This is the hero of Langleey Village.” Stepping out and grabbing hold of Arkk’s arm, the Baron led him into the sitting room.

Two others were inside, both unfamiliar. The first was a rather small man with a tablet of papers he was looking at. He wasn’t *that* small, but next to the man with the sideburns, he *looked* tiny. When the man looked up from his papers, he started squinting as if he couldn’t see Arkk well at all.

The other person in the room was a woman with wild black hair. She stood near the window, apart from the others, and stared out. She must have seen Arkk coming, though she didn’t bother looking his way. Even without her turning toward Arkk, he could see several thick scars running over her face. The skin around her eyes was dark like her skin had charred or she had rubbed black ash on her face.

“The hero of Langleey Village,” the tall man said, drawing Arkk’s attention back to him with a clap of his hands. He stepped closer to Arkk, towering over him. He had to look straight down while Arkk craned his neck up. For a human, he was extremely tall. Maybe taller than Ilya, though only by a small bit. However, if he was trying to be intimidating despite his smile, it wasn’t going to work on Arkk.

After all, every orc was as tall if not taller *and* ten times as muscular. After dealing with them every day for the last few weeks, a skinny tall guy standing a bit too close was kind of annoying rather than unnerving.

“The dear Baron was just regaling us with tales of your heroic deeds.”

“Exaggerations, I’m sure,” Arkk said, not taking a step back. “I’m just a farmer. And sometimes I go out hunting.”

“Oh?” the tall man said, stepping past Arkk to look at a portrait on the wall. A painting that Gert’s wife had done of the river. Probably. It wasn’t that good of a painting.

“Arkk! You’re too humble. He fought off a hundred orcs that day and all their goblins too!”

Arkk closed his eyes. “Definite exaggerations,” he said with a sigh. “I only killed between five and ten orcs. And several goblins. I wasn’t exactly counting at the time.”

“Still quite impressive,” the tall man said, picking up a small wooden horse from the Baron’s mantle. As he spoke, he turned it over a few times like he wasn’t quite sure what it was supposed to be. “I know several proud knights who would have balked at facing even a few orcs.” Sharp brown eyes met with Arkk’s eyes. “How did you do it?”

“I’m a spellcaster with some proficiency in lightning magics.”

“Ah, a fellow sorcerer?” He set the horse back down on its side as he stepped closer to Arkk again. The Baron slipped behind him to right the horse. “Where did you study? Hollens Sorcery Academy is my alma mater. Lovely trees around Hollens.”

Arkk’s eyes widened as he shot a glance around the room, wondering if all of them were spellcasters. They all wore a uniform of sorts. Long black coats with two columns of silver buttons down their front, holding the vests of their coat together with thin straps. Each had a small pin on its collar, a little metal depiction of an eye, except instead of a pupil, it had a vertical bar, adorned with a few notches, touching both the top and bottom of the eye. The shorter man seated on the couch was scribbling things down, looking more like a scribe than anything else, and the woman still had her back to the room as she faced out the window.

Realizing that the taller man was still waiting for an answer, Arkk shifted uneasily. “Didn’t have any formal training,” he said. “Our town is sometimes visited by passing mercenaries and other travelers. I learned from the books of any who were willing to show them to me while in town.”

“Self-taught? And you’ve managed a lightning spell with some degree of success?”

“It is my best spell.”

“Anything else?”

“A handful of minor, beginner-level rituals. Most blow up in my face,” Arkk admitted. When he did so, he couldn’t help but notice the tall man and the short man making eye contact for just a moment, leading to a bout of furious writing from the scribe. “Are… you not the tax collector, sir?”

The tall man looked back to Arkk, teetering backward for a moment before letting out a brief breath; the start of a laugh. The laugh ended before it could get going as the man realized that Arkk was serious.

“How rude of me,” he said, entirely taken aback. “Introductions slipped my mind.” He motioned his hand to the shorter man. “Chronicler Douglas Greesom.”

The shorter man kept writing for a moment but looked up to Arkk with a squint before dipping his head in something that *might* have been a greeting.

“Purifier Agnete,” he continued, moving his hand toward the window.

The woman finally looked toward Arkk. Arkk couldn’t help but suck in a breath. Her eyes…

They reminded him of Vezta’s eyes. Not quite the same. This woman’s eyes were more human, but the whites of her eyes had gone dark. Not completely pitch-black slices of the night sky, just gray, but still. And her irises… Vezta didn’t have irises or pupils, just burning golden suns, but this woman’s irises had a luminescent yellow quality to them, though that might have been the light from the window.

She didn’t nod a greeting or otherwise react. After that brief glance shocked Arkk, she simply turned back to continue gazing out the window.

Some long-lost relative of Vezta? Arkk doubted it. Although her eyes were odd, she was human. He couldn’t quite explain how he *knew* that, he just did.

“And finally,” the tall man said, moving his hand to his chest. “I am Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox.”

He maintained his gaze through his thin glasses. The way he stared and the way he dipped his voice a bit deeper than he had been speaking made Arkk think that he expected some sort of reaction to his unfamiliar titles.

Whatever reaction he had been expecting, it probably wasn’t a sigh of relief. “So, you aren’t the tax collector?”

Vrox—or Darius; Arkk wasn’t sure if both were his name or if one was a continuation of his title—stared a moment before letting out a barking laugh as he clapped his hands together. “Oh, I can’t say I’ve ever been mistaken for a taxman before.”

“Not many others visit bearing official seals of the Duchy,” Arkk said. “Figured you were a collector wanting a report on the village’s yield for the year. That’s why I rushed over. I’ve been working in the fields these past few days and feel I have a pretty strong grasp on what we’ve got. If you aren’t the collector… uh, sorry for interrupting your meeting? Nice to meet you,” he said, slowly backing out the door.

Arkk didn’t know *exactly* what an inquisitor was, but he talked with everyone who came through the village. He had heard of them before, usually in hushed whispers. They somehow worked for both the church and the crown, hunting down the most dangerous individuals in the greater Kingdom of Chernlock, of which the Duchy was a member state.

Although he didn’t know what they were here for, *not* being present felt like a much better option all of a sudden.

“Mister Arkk,” Vrox said, tone polite yet *slightly* less pleasant. “We had a few more questions regarding recent events in the area.”

Grimacing, Arkk stopped. He shot a glance at the Baron. This was *his* job, wasn’t it?

He got a helpless shrug in return.

“The demon summoning. Tell us what happened.”

Although the Baron paled at the mention of demons, Arkk sighed in relief. Of course they were here for that. Not him, Vezta, or Fortress Al-Mir. They probably heard about it from the captured orcs Arkk had sent to Smilesville Burg.

“I’m not sure what to say. There wasn’t a demon summoning. We stopped it.”

“With the orcs now tending your fields?”

Arkk nodded, even though far fewer of them had helped to stop it than were present. “They warned us of the summoning and helped us fight their old chieftain and the orcs loyal to her. After all was said and done, those surviving orcs who refused to assist were sent to Smilesville Burg for the Duke’s men to deal with. The rest agreed to help with the harvest as reparations for attacking in the first place.”

“And the orcs were fine with you sending several of their number to execution?”

“Yes.” Seeing Vrox’s raised eyebrow, Arkk elaborated. “Their old chieftain was *not* popular, to put it simply, nor was anyone who willingly followed her.”

“I see…”

Arkk shifted his weight from one foot to the other, fully expecting a barrage of questions to follow. What were the orcs going to do after? The orcs had likely raided other villages under their former chieftain, should they not face the consequences of their actions? Why weren’t these orcs going to the Duke’s men for judgment following their reparations? What authority had Langleey Village to determine the fates of these orcs?

Instead, Vrox clasped his hands behind his back, taking a few steps forward to loom over Arkk once again. “You have neglected to mention the facet of this incident that I am *most* interested in, Mister Arkk.”

Arkk nervously swallowed. “And that would be?”

“The horror from beyond the stars.”

Arkk didn’t have to hide his confusion. Although he tensed, knowing they were talking about Vezta—she had said that she came from the [STARS]—he was still taken aback by the phrasing. “Horror from beyond the stars? I…” He trailed off, glancing around the room. All three of the inquisitor’s group were staring at him now. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Come now, you’ve deliberately avoided mentioning the presence of that creature. You well know what I speak of.” He wrinkled his nose, all traces of good humor absent from his features. “I could smell its presence draped over you from the moment you walked in.”

“That’s… probably sweat from working in the fields. Sorry, sir, but it is hard work.”

“Black and gold eyes. Blue skin. Appears solid, yet made of slime. Numerous tentacles.”

“Oh!” the Baron said, raising a finger. “Vezta. You’re talking about…” He trailed off, looking between Arkk and Vrox, perhaps realizing that he shouldn’t have said anything at all.

“So you do know it,” Vrox said, the corner of his lip twitching into an unpleasant smile. “I do not appreciate being lied to.”

“She’s not a *horror*,” Arkk said, mind racing. “She helped the village in a time of need. How were we supposed to know who you were talking about before you described her?”

Vrox moved back from Arkk a step, turning slightly to look at the chronicler. “Where is it now? I would love an encounter with the creature.”

*Encounter*. Not meeting. Arkk didn’t like this man’s choice of words.

Vrox turned back to Arkk after his question and stared for a long minute, eyes boring into Arkk’s as if he could detect a lie through willpower alone.

Maybe he could. Arkk didn’t know that much about magic.

“She appeared just in time to help fight the initial raid on the village and stuck around until the demon summoning was successfully stopped. Vezta hasn’t been to the village in at least a week,” he said with a shrug, picking his words carefully. He was telling the truth in full. It wasn’t his fault if the inquisitor took it the wrong way.

After another minute of uncomfortable staring, Vrox’s smile *snapped* into place. The same perfectly polite, friendly smile he had first used when Arkk walked in. “Shame. If it has moved on, nothing to do about it I suppose. Agnete, Douglas.”

The shorter man stood immediately, offering the slightest bow to the Baron before hurrying out of the room. The woman seemed much more reluctant to leave. She lingered at the window, staring out with a stony expression on her face.

“Agnete,” Vrox said again.

That was enough to get her to turn aside. She strode across the room with rigid movements, hands clenched into tight fists that made the leather of her gloves creak.

Away from the sun in the window, Arkk noted that her eyes didn’t glow nearly as much as Vezta’s did. However, the thick scars that marred her face *did* glow. Faint yellow-red lines at the deepest crevasses in her scars made her look like she didn’t have blood under her skin, but hot iron straight out of the smithy furnace.

She stopped in front of Arkk, locking eyes with him. Her lips, darkened much like the skin around her eyes, parted ever so slightly. “You feel… empty…” she whispered, voice barely carrying to Arkk’s ears. It looked like she was going to continue, but ended up turning and leaving the room instead.

“Your cooperation is appreciated, Baron of Langleey,” Vrox said with a shallow nod of his head. Stepping away from the Baron, he stopped at Arkk again. “You should visit the local Abbess and request a purification ritual.”

With that comment, he turned and left the room as well. The front door to the Baron’s manor clicked shut behind them.

Arkk let out a long sigh, stiff back turning to putty.

“I thought they would stay a little longer,” Gert said, obviously disappointed.

Arkk just shook his head. They had stayed quite long enough, in his opinion. He wasn’t sure if Vrox had believed his implication that Vezta wasn’t around anymore. Regardless, he had a feeling that Vrox would be back one way or another.

## 15 - Leaving Langleey


“And then they just left.”

Arkk looked around the room, staring at the morose faces. Well, one morose face.

Fortress Al-Mir had undergone some reorganization. The orcs had a whole village-sized section of the fortress to themselves. Heavy iron doors fabricated by the blacksmith wouldn’t let any of them cross over into a more secluded area for him, Ilya, and Vezta. He and Ilya even had private rooms, made using the same living area magic that allowed the orcs to create personalized homes for themselves.

His room was a fairly simple affair with wood flooring and wood panels on the walls. A large open room covered with a rich violet rug. He had a remarkably comfortable bed, a desk, and a shelf that held just a single black book at the moment. Stone shields hung from the ceiling like chandeliers, their maze-like pattern broken up by a compass rose with a bright gemstone in the middle.

Ilya’s room was a bit more extravagant. It looked like a slice of a castle, complete with a roaring stone fireplace, massive four-poster bed, and large windows that, despite being underground, still managed to look out over the Cursed Forest as if her room was set in a high tower.

Vezta had denied needing room.

*This* room, however, was a dedicated meeting room. It too had walls adorned with maze-engraved shields with compass roses and gemstones. That seemed to be the theme of this place. There was a large table and… that was it. Rekk’ar and Olatt’an sat on one side of the table. Ilya sat next to Arkk. Vezta stood to his other side. Of all of them, Ilya was the only one who looked concerned.

“Horror from beyond the stars?” she repeated, smile a little tighter than normal. Slowly, Ilya looked over to Vezta.

“First, that is highly insulting. Beyond the stars? Really?”

Ilya glanced over, losing her concern for a moment as she raised an eyebrow. “That’s the part you have a problem with?”

“I am from the [STARS]. Not from *beyond* the stars,” she said slowly as if explaining to a child. “Whatever does that mean? These humans know nothing about me.”

“It’s close enough that it gave me a start,” Arkk said. “The orcs we gave to the Duke must have described you. It probably wasn’t a very accurate description, but they still got that much right. That’s enough to be alarmed over; these inquisitors did not look that friendly.”

“They didn’t follow you, did they?” Ilya asked. “Did they see the teleportation circle?”

Arkk shook his head. “I watched from the Baron’s manor until their carriage disappeared over the horizon. The circle is hidden behind the carpentry workshop. They wouldn’t have seen it coming or going.”

“Master,” Vezta said, lips turning to a frown as she spoke. “It may be prudent to destroy the teleportation circles.”

“Destroy? But how will—”

“Not permanently, Master, but anyone capable of magic will be able to appear within our walls at will. With these hostile magic users in the area, the circles are a liability.”

Arkk put his elbows on the table, interlacing his fingers. He could already see Ilya ready to object if he agreed. Vezta was right, of course, but Langleey was their home. Arkk had little doubt that Ilya would abandon the fortress long before she abandoned the village.

Not that they were abandoning it if they destroyed the circles. It would just be less convenient to reach. To her, that was probably the same thing.

“We’ll move them,” Arkk said. “Out of the library and into a more secure room. Perhaps on the surface. Somewhere that someone would have to try to get down here. The passage up and down will be beyond the section of the fortress where the orcs live.”

Rekk’ar, despite caring nothing about the drama of humans showing up knowing something about Vezta, leaned forward and hit the table with his fist. “You plan to use us as guards?”

Arkk, though he flinched at the fist hitting the table, met Rekk’ar’s eyes without wavering. “I hired you all for *something*. That something is certainly not farm work, as you handily proved yesterday. You’re telling me you don’t want to *fight* either? I don’t believe it.”

Rekk’ar held Arkk’s gaze for a few seconds longer before letting out a laugh as he leaned back in his seat. “The human *can* be taught. Wonderful.”

Suppressing a roll of his eyes, Arkk just shook his head. “Speaking of fighting, I wanted to discuss the possibility of mercenary work for the orcs.”

“Mercenary work?”

“You know, hunt down some highwaymen who are causing trouble for travelers or—”

“I know what mercenary work is,” Rekk’ar growled. “I’m asking what jobs you have for us. I imagine some of the rowdier crew would love to get out and take some heads.”

“I don’t have any. We would need to visit a city that posts jobs.” Arkk glanced aside at Ilya.

Her eyes widened. “*Now*? In the middle of harvest?”

“Lousy as the orcs were at working the scythes, we *did* clear out the entire oat field. That is a massive load of work off the village. They’ll be fine without us for the remainder.” He paused a moment, taking a breath, but quickly started speaking before Ilya could say anything. “*Not* to do anything about your mother. At least not yet. We’re going for mercenary jobs, we’re going to get some spell books, we’re going to take a *look* that will help us come up with a better plan for Alya, and now… we need to go to figure out just what this Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox might be planning with us.”

Turning to his other side, Arkk looked over Vezta. The prim and proper servant looked perfectly prepared to agree to whatever he asked. “Can you handle things here for… a week? Two? I hope we wouldn’t be gone longer than that but I honestly don’t know how long it will take to reach Cliff.”

“I am unable to command the [HEART] as you do, I cannot construct rooms or mobilize your forces as you do, but I will defend the [HEART] to my dying breath.”

“I meant, can you keep things running here without the fortress falling to pieces?”

“Oh. That should be possible, yes.”

Nodding, Arkk looked at the two orcs. “I have no idea what your group is both capable of and willing to do. If one of you…”

Olatt’an slowly shook his head, making Arkk trail off. “Your power keeps most in line. With you gone, keeping order falls to us. After that stunt you pulled with the farming, if one of us—”

“Stunt? That was reparations.”

Rekk’ar scoffed. “Whatever you call it, it’s made us… *unhappy*. If one of us is gone, you’ll come back to a burned-out husk of a dungeon.”

Vezta narrowed her eyes. “I won’t allow it.”

“Then you’ll return to a bunch of dead orcs.” Rekk’ar shifted in his seat, clenching his teeth like he didn’t want to admit something. Even still, he opened his mouth. “I’m not strong enough to keep twenty angry orcs in line. Olatt’an carries some respect, but not enough. Aside from that… well…”

“There is a chance I won’t be popular in most human cities,” Olatt’an said, smiling a sad smile. “There is a chance those mercenary postings you wish to look at carry sketches of my face.”

“Alright,” Arkk said with a frown, shooting a glance at Ilya before looking back to Olatt’an. “Do I *want* to ask?”

“Doubtful.”

Arkk pressed his lips together but didn’t ask. Olatt’an was the most levelheaded of all the orcs. He knew he had *something* of a past to have earned the moniker of Ripthroat, but all the orcs had a past. Whatever he *had* been, he wasn’t anymore. And Arkk really couldn’t afford to lose him if it meant riots.

He would ask one day. But not today.

“Take Dakka,” Olatt’an said. “You might not have noticed, but she has been trying to draw your eyes more often lately.”

“Draw my eyes?”

“Besides,” Rekk’ar cut in with a hardy laugh. “She’s short. Less threatening to humans.”

With her massive axe and spiked shield, Arkk didn’t think she was much less threatening. “If we’re going based on that, Larry’s the best choice.”

He meant it as a joke—Arkk *severely* doubted that Larry would be able to talk about the groups' capabilities or willingness to do certain jobs. However, neither of the other two laughed. They just glanced at each other. Arkk took a breath and closed his eyes.

“Is he on wanted posters too?” he said, taking a guess based on their expressions.

“He told you that he had a shack in some human village.”

“Pineberg Burg,” Arkk said, remembering.

“He didn’t tell you why he left.” Olatt’an pressed his lips together. “They found a little girl’s body chopped up in the woods behind his home.”

Ilya gasped. “He didn’t…”

“Says he didn’t,” Rekk’ar said. “And I believe him. I mean, look at the oaf. He’s got a gut, but doesn’t have *the guts*.” After laughing at his joke, Rekk’ar’s face turned serious once more. “When the executioners are on the hunt and you’re an orc in a human settlement, you don’t stick around.”

Arkk closed his eyes, nodding his head. That made an unfortunate amount of sense. He had wondered why Larry was part of their group since first spotting him. It was because he had no choice.

“But Dakka is fine? Not wanted in many cities?”

“Doubt it.”

“Fine. Ilya, Dakka, and I will leave in the morning. You work with Vezta to keep things running here. Destroy the teleportation circles.”

“You can’t use them to get to the city?” Olatt’an asked.

Arkk glanced at Vezta, who shrugged. “I was told that they have a limited range. And to make the existing ones, I had to show Vezta where to put them. I’ve… never actually been to Cliff. I don’t know the way there. I might find it by searching along the roads but…”

“Nor have I,” Ilya said, a slight tremble in her lip. She straightened her back, took a deep breath, and nodded at Arkk. “Let’s do this.”

***

In all his years, Arkk had never left Langleey Village. He had ventured out to the Cursed Forest, and a bit beyond, and Stone Hearth Burg sat just on the edge of the forest he and Ilya had been hunting in. Those were close enough that they didn’t count. He had never been outside the forested plains that Langleey Village was at the center of.

It wasn’t that travel was too far or the journey was overly dangerous. He just never had a reason to do so. There was work to be done around the village. The travelers who passed through might have filled his head with adventure and excitement but when the sun came up, it was time to head back to the fields.

Ilya had left the village twice as far as Arkk knew. Once just a few weeks ago when she had taken a small group of orcs to Smilesville Burg. Once as a young girl, before her mother had been taken. Arkk didn’t know where they had gone, but Ilya hadn’t bragged about it. So, she had never left it either. All Arkk knew was that it was something about her ancestral people.

Walking along the road out of town, Arkk glanced at their third companion. Even though she was the shortest orc in Fortress Al-Mir, she was still just a bit taller than Ilya. Her black hair was tightly woven against either side of her head but was loose on top, hanging down one side of her face to her chin. Dozens of metal rings adorned her ears and even more metal covered the majority of her body in the form of armor.

Arkk considered asking her about her travel history, but… after hearing about Olatt’an and Larry, Arkk wasn’t sure if he wanted to know.

“Are the roads very dangerous these days?” he asked instead.

It took Dakka a moment to realize that Arkk was talking to her, not Ilya. She stiffened, glancing at him with her red eyes. She had dark paint under and around them, presumably to help against the glare of the sun. After taking a long moment to consider his question, she finally answered. “We never traveled the roads,” she said. “If that is what you’re asking.”

“I was wondering more about your armor. We’ve got a long journey ahead of us. It isn’t too late for me to send it back to the fortress if you don’t want to lug it around.”

Ilya had her black and white elvish bow and Arkk had a sword—though he planned to use magic over metal if at all possible—they had otherwise packed light. Well, mostly light. A significant fraction of the weight Arkk had in his pack was gold.

“If… you don’t mind, Sir, I would prefer if I kept my equipment.” She sounded stiff, afraid of offending him. “You said we would hire a wagon in the next burg.”

“That is true, but we won’t reach it today.” As much as Arkk would have liked to take horses from Langleey, they just couldn’t spare them at the moment. Not with the harvest going on.

“I’ll be fine. I’ve walked much more than a day with the horde.”

Arkk let the topic drop. Occasionally, as they walked on, he would try to draw Dakka into a conversation. The topics ranged from thoughts about what Cliff might be like with Ilya, musings about what Vezta might get up to in their absence, and even what kind of travel food was best. Dakka gave clipped responses, grunts that might have been agreements or disagreements, or just tried to avoid getting looped into the conversations altogether.

By the time night fell and they stopped for camp, Arkk was wondering if he had done something to upset Dakka. They didn’t speak often, but when they did, he hadn’t thought their interactions were quite so stiff.

Ilya took the first watch.

Partway through the night, Arkk found himself shaken awake. Nothing happened during Ilya’s watch. Her brief statement about whatever she had seen had been more of a yawn than a proper sentence but she kicked him off the small mat and immediately crawled onto it. Through the link between them, he could tell that she had fallen asleep almost the second her head hit the pillow.

At the same time, through the same link, he could tell that Dakka was not asleep. At least, she wasn’t anymore. The orc hadn’t brought any kind of mat and was just leaning up against a tree, shield over her body as if it were a particularly stiff blanket. Her eyes were closed and her breathing was steady, but Arkk could still tell that she was wide awake.

The fire was still going, he noted. It wasn’t a proper wood-burning fire, but the same magical ritual he had thought was a light spell back when he first found Fortress Al-Mir. He didn’t think it should have lasted this long, but…

Well, the [HEART] provided a massive advantage to spellcasters in that it refilled its contractor’s magic at an absurd rate, according to Vezta. The more minions and territory, the greater the capacity and throughput. So he wasn’t too surprised that the little flame was going.

Crouching down next to the flame, trying to warm himself up a bit, Arkk kept stealing glances at Dakka, wondering if she had slept at all. Was she worried about an attack? Ilya hadn’t been or she never would have just fallen asleep as she had, and elves could see at night and hear better than humans or orcs could.

Then what? Was it him? Ilya?

“Are you alright, Dakka?” he said, deciding to just ask. He didn’t look up from the fire as he spoke, still rubbing his hands together and holding them over it.

Dakka remained still for a long moment, but she eventually opened her eyes. “You knew I was awake?”

Arkk shrugged. “Guessed,” he lied. He hadn’t told anyone the full power the [HEART] gave him over those in his employ. Being able to teleport them around within his territory was alarming enough. They didn’t need to know more. “Did I do something to upset you?”

That got a reaction from her. Her eyes widened and she sat up straight. “No. Of course not.” She paused, then added, “Sir.”

“Why so formal and stiff? I don’t remember you being this way back in the fortress. You usually seemed… excited to see me, if anything.”

“We’re on a mission,” Dakka answered after a long moment.

“It isn’t that kind of mission. We’re just camping and traveling together as friends, not marching off to kill another demon summoner.”

“Friends?”

“Yeah. I mean… unless…”

Maybe that was the wrong word to use. He had kind of threatened Dakka, along with the rest of the orcs, into joining up with him. Ostensibly, he was her superior in whatever hierarchy the fortress had. Vezta had said that he was to be a leader, but he didn’t *feel* like the position was right for him. Rather, he felt like a babysitter, watching the village children while their parents went on a long hunt. Instead of rambunctious children, they were an army of orcs.

Dakka leaned back against the tree, slowly closing her eyes without saying anything else. Arkk figured the conversation had died a miserable death, but she slowly started speaking.

“Hearing movement around me while I sleep is generally a sign that something bad is about to happen.”

Arkk looked up, but her eyes were still closed.

“I would wake up to find the bottoms of my boots missing, my axe slammed against a rock to dull or chip its edge. Or, I might even be woken up by the others throwing stones at me.”

“The orcs did that?” Arkk asked, aghast. “Because you’re a little smaller than the others?”

“There is always a runt.”

“Not here,” Arkk said. “In case you hadn’t noticed, both Ilya and I are smaller than you.” Even if it wasn’t by much in Ilya’s case.

“Physically,” Dakka countered. “She’s your right hand. You’re… you.”

“Regardless, neither of us are going to attack you. I fully intend to get a few more hours of sleep, so you best be up for watch in a couple of hours. That means getting rest.”

Dakka’s eyes snapped open. She stared for a long moment, utterly still, before speaking slowly, one word at a time. “You… trust me with watch?”

“Of course? Should I not?”

“No! No, Sir! You can count on me.”

“Good. Then get some sleep.”

“Yes, Sir.”

“And quit that. I’m just Arkk.”

Dakka stared, nodded, then closed her eyes again. She didn’t fall asleep immediately, of course, but Arkk felt her doze off before too long. Before waking her up for watch, Arkk spent a few minutes examining Fortress Al-Mir. Even away from it, he could still see everything going on inside its halls. He could even move its occupants around at will if he needed to. Not that he did, right now. Everything seemed calm and business as usual.

Come morning, Dakka was a bit less stiff and stand-offish, so Arkk counted their little conversation as a win. She even started a conversation or two on the walk. Nothing consequential, just small talk about fighting, mostly.

All conversation came to an abrupt halt as they spotted Smilesville Burg.

“Maybe we shouldn’t have come here,” Arkk said slowly.

Ilya looked sick. “Barbaric.”

The burg itself was a large city. Ten Langleey Villages could have fit within its walls. It *had* walls. Large stone defensive walls with periodic towers along them. Homes and other buildings dotted the land outside the walls, and the land itself was covered in fields far larger than Langleey had. People toiled around in the fields. It was harvest here as well.

But what really stopped the conversation were the wooden poles erected along the path to the city.

Rotted, fetid corpses of orcs hung from ropes on the poles, dangling in the light breeze as carrion feeders pecked at bits of dangling flesh.

Arkk kept his eyes locked on the sight but used his power over the [HEART] to check on Dakka. A strange double-vision hit Arkk, letting him see the orc as if he were facing her. She looked on, face mostly impassive. To her, this didn’t matter, it was just a thing that happened. Arkk wondered if the slight curl in her lip was a smile. Given what she had said last night, some or all of those might have been among her tormentors.

How many of the orcs in his employ had attacked her in her sleep?

Eventually, Dakka glanced over. “Why did we stop? You knew they were going to be executed when you brought them here, right?” she shrugged. “They deserved it.”

“I didn’t think they’d…” Ilya trailed off, shaking her head in disgust. “It’s been weeks! They should have buried them.”

“It’s a warning to other raiders,” Dakka said with another shrug. “Stay in line or go for a swing.”

“Ugh.”

“Stay close to us,” Arkk said. “Don’t want them getting any ideas about you. Let’s just see if they’ve got a cart we can buy, some provisions, and get out of here before anyone notices we’re here.”

“Like they’re going to miss me,” Dakka scoffed. Still, as they started walking again, she stepped closer to Arkk, sliding between him and Ilya.

In the end, Arkk had rushed their departure even more than he thought he needed to. The more they walked through town, the more it looked like a lynch mob might form. It was a shame. He had wanted to check around and see how one might take on mercenary jobs. Getting jobs at the closest burg, one still within range of Fortress Al-Mir, would have been convenient.

Still, even as hostile as the town was, they were more than willing to accept a few gold coins for what he needed. Supplies, a horse and cart, and directions.

With that, they were off toward the City of Cliff.

## 16 - The City of Cliff


Cliff was unlike anything Arkk had ever seen before.

Arkk wasn’t sure if he was vibrating in excitement or shaking from nerves. He was finally out of Langleey Village, traveling and seeing the world. Technically, he had been traveling for a week now, but some of the luster of travel had worn off once he realized that most villages weren’t meaningfully different from his village and most burgs were just larger villages.

Unlike the places they had traveled through to reach here, *this* was a *city*.

It was a bit annoying to get to. There was a big… well, mountainous *cliff* in the way. A large heap of earth and rock propped up into a thin mountain. Following the winding road around the mountain, past truly massive swaths of farmland, brought him to the city itself. Houses and buildings were crammed next to each other in tight rows. They sprawled back and forth, filling every available spot between the ocean and the mountain itself.

But the city itself didn’t look *that* impressive until one looked out to the ocean. A wide stone bridge over the water connected the city to another mountain, one that jutted right out of the waves. It wasn’t quite as high as the one on proper land, but it was what was *on* it that mattered.

There were a number of grandiose buildings built into the sides of the mountain, but at a certain point near the top, the entire mountain leveled off, supported by tall brick walls and natural cliff faces. Atop the plateau was the largest church Arkk had ever seen, stretching almost as tall as the mainland mountain. Arkk thought this might have been the first *temple* that he ever saw. There had been large churches in a few of the burgs on the way here, but this was on another level entirely.

Vezta would have hated it. Its white walls were adorned by golden symbols that seemed to glow, though that might have been a trick of the high sun.

Arkk didn’t see any storehouses and rotting food sitting out as he had heard, but this was just before harvest. Taxes wouldn’t have been collected yet.

There wasn’t much of a wall around the city. There was one, but it just ended at the mountain. The natural terrain was enough of a deterrent to any attacking forces. Two massive ballista-like devices sat atop towers on either side of the gate, ready to decimate any siege equipment that made it this far. Though, Arkk wasn’t sure if there had ever been an attack on the city before. Also unlike other burgs Arkk had visited on the way here, the guards around the large gate were stopping each cart.

Arkk was getting a little nervous as they approached. Why were the guards stopping carts? Had it been a mistake to bring Dakka? Would they reject her? What about Ilya? The elf had her ears tucked into a small hat again, hoping to disguise what she was from the Duke’s prying eyes, but if the guards ran up to her and started examining her, what were they to do? Fortress Al-Mir was well beyond reach at this point. He could still see it and move things around within his territory, but he had no territory anywhere nearby.

When Arkk finally brought their cart to a stop next to a pair of pike-wielding soldiers in blue and white striped tabards, he had worked himself into a nervous tension. One pikeless guard, along with a younger boy who held a note tablet and pen, stopped at the side of their cart. He barely looked up at Arkk.

“Local?”

“What?”

The guard threw a flat look at Arkk. “Are you from around here?”

“Oh. No.”

“Name, origin, profession if relevant, and purpose for visit,” the guard said in an utter monotone.

Clearing his throat to buy a moment for his bewilderment to die down, Arkk answered honestly. Mostly. “Arkk. I’m from Smilesville. Here to purchase a few books, if possible, and maybe have a look at mercenary work.”

The guard changed his demeanor with the mention of mercenary work, now looking over them with a bit more of a critical eye. He started with Arkk, looking him up and down, before turning his attention to Ilya and finally Dakka. When he turned back to Arkk, he let out a small breath through his nose. “Right,” he said, a slight laugh in his tone.

Arkk pressed his lips together, unsure of what the guard found funny, but decided not to comment. The guard wasn’t calling for Dakka’s head. It wouldn’t be a good idea to press their luck.

“Are you or any of your companions wanted in any of the four great states?” the guard asked, tone bored once more. Arkk shook his head, still not sure about Dakka but not willing to say yes to this guard no matter what. In response, the guard moved on with what had to be a script that he read dozens of times a day. “Are you transporting any magical artifacts, cursed items, enchanted items, or holy items?”

Again, Arkk shook his head. “No, Sir. Just what you see here. We’ve got some food and camping supplies, but nothing else.”

Arkk wasn’t even sure if the guard heard him, because he just continued with another question. “Are you transporting any alchemical solutions, magic reagents, or blighted fungus?”

“No.”

“Are you or any of your companions practicing necromancy?”

Arkk shifted, hesitating a moment before quickly shaking his head. “No.”

“Are you or any of your companions currently infected with blighted fungus?”

Arkk glanced to Ilya, who gave him a blank look, then back to Dakka. The orc offered a shrug and a shake of her head. “I… don’t think so. No.” Arkk honestly had no idea what that was. It sounded bad. If they were asking about it, it probably was bad.

The guard looked up again, rolled his eyes, and started waving his hand as he stepped back. “Whatever, you’re probably fine.”

“Oh.” Arkk blinked twice, surprised. Was blighted fungus not something to worry about then? “So, we can go in?”

“Don’t cause trouble.”

“No, Sir.” Arkk started to grab the reins, only to pause and look back to the guard. “I don’t suppose you know where we might be able to get lodging and food for a few nights?”

Arkk did not miss the way the guard’s eyes flicked to Dakka before answering. “The only place I would try if I were you is Primrose.” He looked into the city, beyond the large gate, and pointed with his entire arm. “Down the street, take a left turn at the large brown building toward the end. From there, continue forward until you reach the waterfront. Follow the waterfront past the harbor and you’ll eventually see Primrose down a street on the right. It has a yellow and black sign.”

“Right. Thanks.”

As they followed the guard’s directions, Arkk couldn’t help but think that the people who passed through Langleey Village were wrong. Almost every one of them mentioned the fresh salt-sea air as being something wonderful about Cliff—or any oceanside town. But now that he was tasting it for himself, Arkk did not agree. It wasn’t crisp like the air after a long rainstorm. It was… soggy. The air hung in his nose. If he were being honest, it made him feel a bit nauseous.

He definitely would not be bragging about the ocean breeze anytime soon.

The next big shock were ships. As big as the Baron’s manor with massive spires of wood sticking out of them. He had heard about them from visitors, but seeing one in person? He could hardly believe they floated, let alone moved. He had seen shallow-bottomed riverboats before, so he tried not to be too surprised. It wasn’t a very good try, however. These ships were in an entirely different class.

Continuing along, the wonder of the city started to die off as he realized that the route the guard had provided was taking them into progressively less well-maintained sections of the town. Buildings weren’t quite as intact as they had been elsewhere. Rotted wood that didn’t fit together in snug seams, possibly rotten from that unpleasant salty air, made up most of the buildings out here.

Perhaps he should have noticed earlier, but entering this section of the city just made it all the more apparent that demihumans and beastmen weren’t exactly welcome around Cliff. From the gates up until about halfway through the harbor, Cliff had been dominated by humans. The guards hadn’t barred Dakka from entering and the occasional demihumans were wandering around. Here, however, was the opposite. The occasional human was interspaced by elves, dark elves, and orcs for the most part. Arkk did spot a gremlin smoking a pipe while leaning against a wall, a pair of fairies flying overhead on their thin wings, and even what he was pretty sure was a sphinx lounging outside one building.

Neither of his companions spoke, but Arkk could feel the dour mood that had settled in as they continued through the city.

Arkk almost missed the turn for Primrose. It wasn’t even that he was distracted looking at demihumans he had heard about but had never seen before. There was a signboard but the colors on it were so faded that he would have been better instructed to look for a gray and slightly lighter gray signboard where the remnants of paint were maybe in the shape of a primrose flower.

A small stable next to the Primrose building handled the cart and horse for a small fee. He had long since broken down a few gold coins into a pouch of silver on their journey, which was by far preferable. Paying in gold was sure to draw attention and it was kind of a waste; when faced with a gold coin, a lot of merchants didn’t have enough silver on hand to cover the difference… or they didn’t want to cover the entire difference because then they wouldn’t have any silver themselves. Arkk had ended up overpaying for a lot of goods unintentionally but was unable to do anything… and then there were the merchants who, upon seeing a gold coin, suddenly had price increases on all their wares.

Primrose was a stayover cabin, although a bit larger than the three they had stayed in on the journey. Most larger burgs had them. It was a strange concept, a building dedicated to people traveling. Smaller villages, including Langleey, housed visitors in the local church or individual homes if there was a spare room.

The entire ground floor was dominated by the smell of roasting meat. Several people, mostly demihumans with the occasional beastman or human thrown between, occupied a number of tables. The kitchens were over on one side, but Arkk spotted a woman behind a rounded counter that looked like the right place to start.

The proprietor of Primrose was an elderly little human. Her hair was almost as silver as Ilya’s, though from old age rather than a natural coloration. She leaned forward when Arkk approached, holding a hand to her ear.

“Do you have any rooms available?” Arkk asked, raising his voice.

The old woman slowly ran her eyes over the group. Once finished, she opened a small drawer at the counter she sat behind and pulled out an old iron key in a shaking hand. “Two silvers a night,” she said.

Arkk raised his eyebrows but didn’t argue. That was less than half the price the stayovers in the burgs had charged. “Not sure how long we’ll be staying,” Arkk said, handing over three nights' worth of payment. “If we stay longer, is that a problem?”

“Only if you don’t pay, dearie,” she said, sweeping the coins into another drawer.

“Good. Good. I don’t suppose you would know the best place to acquire books on magic and books—or just someone to talk to—about history?”

“I don’t know much about history, but the magical academy built into the mountainside is where all the spellcasters study.”

Hopefully one of the spellcasters there would have more information on purchases. He wasn’t all that interested in sticking around, learning magic at the academy in the long term. He wanted books he could take back home. Scholars seemed like a good place to start with history as well. He wasn’t sure that they would find anything on Fortress Al-Mir or Vezta’s former master, but anything they did find might be useful.

“How about somewhere we might inquire about mercenary work?”

Somewhere behind him, Arkk heard a distinctive snort. He half-turned but didn’t see who it might have been. Ilya leaned close, whispering in his ear, “Does everyone think we can’t handle ourselves? If they saw what we did at the barrows…”

Arkk just shrugged his shoulders as the old woman began talking again. “You’ll want to stop by the garrison,” she said, then looked over Arkk’s shoulder. “But they won’t enjoy the presence of your companions.”

Lips pressed together, Arkk nodded. “And… is there any method to go about getting a meeting with the Duke?”

The old woman stared. Her mouth flapped a few times, but no words came out. She just stared.

It wasn’t just her. There was a small ripple effect through the room where casual conversations died off into hushed whispers. Even those were quickly silenced. Arkk wondered just how many people had been listening in on his questions.

“Did you hear that boys?” someone eventually shouted. “They want a meeting with the Duke!”

That was the signal for the entire room to descend into a fit of cruel laughter. It didn’t last long and regular conversation sprung up again. The few words Arkk caught of it now centered around their group and what they could possibly want from the Duke. Or what they could be thinking. Ilya’s face darkened as the conversations continued, making him wonder what her sharp ears picked up.

“Well, thanks for the room and information,” Arkk said with a polite smile to the old woman.

“Upstairs, down the long hallway, third door on the left,” she said, leaning back. “Don’t make trouble.”

“Not the first time I’ve heard that today,” Arkk mumbled, shooting a glance at Ilya.

The room wasn’t bad. It was as worn down as the rest of the building, but the bed looked decent enough. There was only one bed, but no one present was bothered by that. They slept in the back of the cart on a few of the nights when they hadn’t made it to any villages or burgs.

“What were they laughing at?” Ilya hissed as she tossed her rucksack on the floor.

“Maybe if we were dressed in our nice clothes rather than our travel clothes,” Arkk said with a small shrug. He had known that just walking up and meeting the Duke wasn’t going to be as simple as it sounded. They would have to figure something out. For now… “How secure do you think this room is?” he asked, looking at the handle on the door.

“I could break the walls down with my shoulder,” Dakka said, knocking her knuckles on the wood. “Doubt it would be that hard.”

“Yes, but how likely is that?”

“If they—” Dakka paused, stepped away from the wall, and dropped her voice to a near whisper. “If they see how much you’re carrying around? Guaranteed.”

“Is it really that much? I only took a small—”

“A single gold coin is a life-changing amount to most of the people living here,” Dakka interrupted. Arkk clamped his jaw shut but was fairly happy to be interrupted by the orc. He would much rather have her speak her mind than be stiff and unresponsive. “I’ve never been here, never spoken with anyone who lived here, but you can just tell by looking around the place.”

Arkk nodded slowly. He had noticed on the way in but hadn’t thought about it in terms of coins. A part of him wondered why the people here stayed here. Everything was so run down. Shunted away into the ass-end of the city as they were, the demihumans were not welcome in the rest of the city. He had only spoken with two people so far and both had insinuating comments to make about Dakka at the very least.

They all had two legs—or wings in the case of those fairies—why stick around? Langleey had been happy to have the help of a bunch of orcs that had attacked only a few weeks prior. Surely other villages nearby would be the same. If they put in a bit of work in helping out the farms, they would surely be more welcome out there than inside the city.

“Well,” he said, approaching the window. There was no glass. Two heavy wooden shutters swung outward, allowing light and fresh air in. His nose wrinkled as soon as he realized that fresh air meant ocean air, but he looked out nonetheless. The tall church in the distance gleamed in the sunlight over the tops of nearby buildings. “We’ve got some starting places,” he said. “The magic academy and the garrison.”

Aside from the church, the view out the window wasn’t that good. Just rooftops for a street or two before taller buildings blocked the rest of the city. He couldn’t even see the water of the ocean.

“The latter of which isn’t a good place for us,” Ilya said with a frown. “And the former… I have no idea what I’d even be looking for in a magic library.”

Dakka grunted in agreement. “You want to know more about…” she hesitated, glancing at Ilya for a moment. “About an elf consort of the Duke’s?”

Ilya pressed her lips together, shooting a mild glare at Dakka. The phrasing could have been better, but it wasn’t exactly inaccurate. “My mother. Alya,” Ilya eventually said. “I don’t know *exactly* what the Duke wanted with her, but… She would have appeared here roughly fifteen years ago.”

“Sounds like a job I can do,” Dakka said, motioning toward the door. “Kick around these parts, find the places where people ask questions, and see about learning why everyone laughed at our meeting with the Duke. If I read the atmosphere right, they’ll be more willing to talk to me than a human and an elf hiding her ears.”

“Will you be alright on your own?” Arkk asked.

Dakka snorted. Or scoffed. Both? “I’d be more worried about you two.”

“I can take care of myself,” Ilya said with a note of irritation in her tone.

“I’m going to try the garrison first,” Arkk said. “Tomorrow morning. Then I’ll head over and see if I can’t find anything at the academy. Ilya, do you want to go with—”

“I want to explore.”

“Explore?”

“Just… run through the city for a day. See it with my own eyes.”

“Alright,” Arkk said after a moment. “I don’t have to tell you to be careful.”

Ilya nodded, adjusting her hat.

“Well, I don’t know about the two of you, but whatever they were roasting downstairs smelled like the best thing I haven’t eaten. *I’m* going to go correct that. Join me?” Arkk asked, glancing between the two of them.

Having had nothing but travel provisions for the last day and a half, since they left one of the burgs, the two of them readily agreed.

## 17 - Investigating the Leads


As it turned out, the garrison and the academy were fairly close to one another. Both were built into the mainland mountain that shadowed Cliff. Both even had similar architecture on the exterior, that being miniature keep-like structures that extended out from the sheer face of the mountain. The difference was that one kept a contingent of guards standing around its entrances.

Adjusting the odd jacket of his dark suit, Arkk stood in the middle of a small line. He had dressed up, deciding to make use of the fancier clothes that he had. Maybe it was because a lesser servant had been the tailor or maybe it was just the style of the suit, but he didn’t quite feel like it fit. The shoulders felt too tight and it rubbed against his neck.

“Name and business,” a guard behind a wire mesh window asked as Arkk stepped up.

Keeping his back straight and his expression as serious as he could manage, Arkk introduced himself. “Arkk. I’m here to inquire about mercenary work.”

The guard’s eyes looked up from a tablet of vellum and roved over Arkk. Unlike the previous times he had mentioned looking for mercenary work, the guard did not laugh or make any snide comments. He simply looked back to his vellum and nodded. “Are you making specific inquiries, posting work, or looking for work?”

“The latter, please.”

“Open bounties, recruitment notices, and other matters of interest for routiers are posted on the southern wall of the garrison, just to your left.”

“Oh. Thank you,” Arkk said, stepping out of line.

Following the guard’s directions, he found a large board up against the stone wall, shielded from the elements by a heavy awning overhead. Rows of paper, each stamped with an official-looking seal covered the board. There were a wide variety of jobs on the board. Some were mundane and offered low rewards, such as gathering certain herbs and roots from a forest or assisting villages that had a shortage of labor. Arkk dismissed those entirely for the moment; his orcs had already tried the latter option and he had no desire to further encourage a riot.

Others were a bit more interesting. A merchant wanted an armed escort for traveling between a few burgs that Arkk didn’t recognize. Another person wanted escorts to guard an expedition to some ancient temple. Someone had lost a daughter, as in physically could not find her, and was wanting to hire trackers and others who specialized in finding people. For a moment, that one sounded like a job he could do right now if the daughter had left behind hair or something else he could use, but the longer he thought about it, the more an unpleasant feeling swam through his gut.

He forced himself to stop thinking about the tracking spell before he threw up.

The two most rewarding jobs were by far the most interesting. The first was a request to gather samples of blighted fungus for study. Arkk still didn’t know what that was, though maybe it was time to start asking around. Judging by the amount offered for the job, it must have been dangerous stuff. The other job, only slightly more rewarding, was a request to clear out a mine that had been overrun with gorgon.

Arkk didn’t know exactly what a gorgon was. The name sounded familiar. Thinking back, he thought he heard about it from some mercenaries in his childhood. One of the groups that passed through Langleey with stories to tell. Nothing specific jumped out at him from those memories, however. He reached out, lifting the paper in the hopes of finding more details underneath, but before he could, a rough hand landed on his shoulder.

“Wouldn’t pick that one, mate.”

Jolting, not having been paying attention to those around him, Arkk turned to find a man with a flat face and a pointed nose giving him a serious look.

“Nasty beasts, gorgons. Their coils can crush steel, their venom melts flesh from bone, and if that wasn’t bad enough, they’re known to turn men to stone. Wouldn’t take that job if it were offering ten times the amount.”

“Men to stone?” Arkk said. That… sounded familiar. The mercenary group he had been thinking of might have abandoned the job in fear of two gorgon. “What about women?”

After staring at him for a moment, the man let out a loud laugh and clapped Arkk on the shoulder. “Good one,” he said at the end of his laugh. Taking his hand from Arkk’s shoulder, he held it out. “Name’s Hawkwood. Friends call me Hawk. White Company senior commander.”

“Arkk,” Arkk said, taking the man’s hand. Hawkwood’s attire was simplistic. Just a tunic with a leather jacket. A shield pin with a black chevron adorned his breast pocket. “You’re a mercenary company?”

“White Company is. I’m just a man. Don’t recognize you though.”

“You know everyone?”

Hawkwood shook his head. “Just everyone in the mercenary business. So, imagine my surprise when a dusty farmboy shows up reaching for the most dangerous job on the board. Wouldn’t the herbs be more your speed?”

“Farmboy? Dusty?” Arkk glanced down at his suit. He had taken care to keep it clean on the journey and that hadn’t changed in the last few hours since he put it on.

“You’ve got the clothes, but you don’t wear them like you belong. Your hands are calloused and not in the way a soldier’s would be. The back of your neck is heavily tanned, even more than your face, meaning you spend a lot of time looking down at the ground. Your hair is dry and unkempt. Anyone wearing clothes like that would grease their hair down every morning. There’s—”

“Alright, alright,” Arkk said, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand and brushing his fingers through his hair with the other. “So the clothes are useless?” Vezta was going to be disappointed.

“You might fool some people, but not me,” Hawkwood said with a grin. “So, what’s the story?”

Arkk sighed. “Just trying to figure out how all this works. I wasn’t going to take the job. Probably.”

“Probably?”

“Some very strange things happened recently and now I find myself with twenty-something orcs following my lead.” Hawkwood’s eyebrows crept up his forehead and he started looking around, making Arkk shake his head. “They aren’t here. I just wanted to find something for them to do so they don’t tear each other apart.”

“Did you want to get them killed?”

“No! Of course not.”

“Then skip over that job. Demihumans aren’t immune to gorgons either.”

Arkk wondered if Vezta might be immune. She had said that she survived a lot of things over the years. Then again, she hadn’t been positive that she would survive the orc chieftain’s magic.

“At least you’re seeing sense,” Hawkwood said, reading his face. “Well? What’s the story with the orcs?”

“A long one.”

“Tell you what, you tell me the story and I’ll show you the ropes. Get you putting those orcs to work. I’ll even throw in a meal.”

Arkk wasn’t sure he liked how Hawkwood phrased that, but it didn’t sound like the worst deal. At least not so long as he edited the story a bit. Those inquisitors had already been asking about Vezta. He didn’t need even more people talking about her or Fortress Al-Mir.

---

“Farm work?” Hawkwood’s fist hit the table as he laughed. “You made a bunch of warriors do farm work? I’m surprised they didn’t take your head for suggesting that!”

“It certainly didn’t win me any points with them,” Arkk said with a faint smile, skewering another slice of fish. Maybe he was just used to the river fish from around Langleey, but he wasn’t sure he liked oceanic fish much. It was the largest food industry in Cliff, so he supposed he would just have to get used to it. “Although, while we were farming, we got interrupted… Can you tell me anything about inquisitors?”

Hawkwood’s lingering chuckles died in an instant. He sobered up, snapping his gaze around the patio where they had gotten their meal from the vendor. Unlike the Primrose, however, it didn’t look like too many people were paying attention to their conversation.

“No good business comes from inquisitors,” Hawkwood said, all humor gone from his voice. “Inquisitors showed up while you were farming with the orcs?”

Arkk nodded. “They asked me a number of questions about the demon summoning. I told them basically what I just told you. Then… they asked about stars.” It was a bit of a risk to mention that, but at the same time, Arkk wondered if the more experienced mercenary might have some information. “Had no clue what they were talking about,” he added with a shrug.

Unfortunately, Hawkwood didn’t react to Arkk mentioning stars. “If they weren’t interested in demons, it was probably that magic you were throwing around. The church hates spellcasters that didn’t go to their approved academies. The orcs you sent to the burg talked, something about the way they described the magic made someone else call up the church.”

“Me? Not the magic the summoner was using?”

Hawkwood shrugged. “They hounded *you*, right?”

“Yes,” Arkk lied. They had been there for Vezta, not him. But he had already dropped the hint about stars. No need to say anything else.

“There you have it. I’d go get checked out at the academy, but if the inquisitors left without clapping your wrists in irons, you’re probably fine.”

Arkk stretched, then stood. “I was actually planning on stopping over there after the garrison,” he said. “Thanks for telling me about mercenary work.”

“No problem. It isn’t every day a new mercenary company pops up. Especially not one made up of demihumans.” Hawkwood stood as well, then held out his hand once more. “If you need any more help, stop on by the White Company building. It’s just down the road from the garrison. Can’t miss it.” He paused, then slowly nodded his head. “In fact, I have a contact who might appreciate you looking into a job that you and a bunch of orcs could do. Why not stop by in the morning?”

“Sounds good. I’ll bring my companions if that isn’t a problem.”

“The orcs?”

“One of them and then an elf.” Arkk frowned, looking the man in the eyes. “That isn’t a problem, is it?”

Hawkwood shook his head. “Not with me.”

“Good. See you then.”

With that end to their conversation, Arkk headed toward his second destination of the day. Helpful though Hawkwood had been, the mercenary work was just a diversion. Something that needed doing but not something he had been particularly interested in.

The magic academy was a *passion*.

Getting close to the Cliff academy sent tingles up his arms. Arkk honestly couldn’t tell if it was magic in the air or just his excitement, but by the time he walked through the wide-open gates and stepped into the academy foyer, he was positively vibrating.

And what a foyer it was. Carved straight into the mountainside, it almost felt like walking into the [HEART] chamber of Fortress Al-Mir. Except, instead of a floating magical artifact of unknown origin, there was a massive statue of a man in golden robes with one hand extended out as if welcoming people through the tall doors. His other hand held tight a thick scroll. Runes on the scroll glowed a brilliant gold that illuminated the entire statue.

The people walking about were scholarly types. Most wore clothes a lot like the suit Arkk had on, but he could tell just by looking at them that they had no muscle at all underneath. On average, at least. There were the odd ones that stood out. Hawkwood had been right about the hair, however. Every single person, man and woman, had styled, almost shining hair.

Pulling his collar up to hide the back of his neck, Arkk wandered through the halls, a bit disappointed when they turned out to be far more narrow and claustrophobic than the impressive foyer or even the corridors of Fortress Al-Mir. The lighting was poor as well. The academy didn’t use torches—something about Fortress Al-Mir made the soot and smoke vanish in a way that probably wouldn’t work here—but its glowstones weren’t half as strong as those used in certain rooms of the fortress.

He passed several rooms. Some looked like lecture halls. Others were obviously for practical magic usage. An alchemy station with bubbling alembics and glass tubes caught his attention for a moment but Arkk already had enough on his plate without learning a whole other discipline. Maybe another time.

Arkk stopped at an open door, spotting two people standing across from one another on a raised platform. Demonstrating something? Dueling? They had a small crowd watching. A crowd that Arkk found himself joining in, momentarily pausing his efforts to locate a library.

“—can block any energy-based spell with few exceptions. However, physical objects require a separate spell. As most outside these halls are not spellcasters, blocking physical objects is often more useful. The element is wind. The motion is a spinning sweep of your hands. The visualization is effectively a solid wall, but slightly more complicated. You may read my dissertation for more details. The incantation is *hentikan semua benda yang masuk sebelum mencapai dagingku*.” As soon as the woman on stage spoke the incantation, a haze enveloped her. A shimmer in the air, like fog, settled in, but only in a bubble around her person. Arkk couldn’t see through it clearly but her silhouette was there.

Turning away from the audience, the silhouette motioned.

On the other side of the stage, a tall man in a tall hat lifted a heavy wooden staff. With a motion from the staff, a dozen small rocks lifted from the ground in front of him. With another gesture, the rocks flew across the stage faster than arrows, but they didn’t make it through the haze around the woman. They sunk in, stopping rapidly, before going completely still. Most interestingly, they didn’t fall to the floor. Not until the woman canceled the spell and dispersed the haze.

“Unfortunately,” the woman said, “this spell is still in a prototype phase. While active, visibility is next to nothing. I’m working on that. Still, perhaps it will save your life. Commit it to memory.”

Arkk blinked a few times. The crowd around him nodded their heads, but all he could think was *how*. That spell, *hentikan semua something something something* was, first of all, far too long. *Electro Deus* was nice and snappy. Quick to speak, quick to cast, easy to remember. So was *Slave Natum*, for that matter. Her spell did look useful, visibility issue aside, but by the time he finished the incantation, he would wind up a pincushion of crossbow bolts and swords. The black book he stole from the summoner had similarly long spells in it. Flesh Weaving, which was twice as long as that, was the only one he had tried so far. It required such intense focus and concentration that using it on the battlefield would have been impossible anyway, making its long incantation not that big of an issue.

Unfortunately, Arkk didn’t get a chance to see more magic. That spell was the end of the demonstration. The others in the crowd meandered off toward the door, discussing the spell on the way. Some were calling it revolutionary, so it was apparently a big deal. Arkk… wondered if any of them had been in combat ever in their lives.

Arkk remained in place. The man with the staff used it to retrieve the stones, which he quickly pocketed. At the same time, the woman started cleaning up ritual circles on the ground that must have been used in earlier demonstrations.

“Excuse me?” Arkk said, approaching the stage. He had probably passed a dozen persons of authority in the hall on the way here, but he couldn’t tell the difference between a learner and a teacher by attire alone. This woman seemed close enough.

The woman looked up, violet eyes staring through the thin lenses of her glasses. Irritation flashed across her face before she put on a polite, if forced, smile. “Was there a question you had about my spell?”

“Ah. Yes?” Arkk almost asked about a library first but didn’t want to upset her by *not* asking about her revolutionary new spell. “You said this was a prototype? Is the incantation going to be shorter in the final version?”

“It is quite short already,” she said, looking surprised. “Twenty syllables.”

“It’s short?” Arkk asked, surprised as well. “Have you ever been in a fight before?”

The woman sneered, adjusting the long black cloak she wore open over a stylish bodice. “Do I look like some kind of ruffian to you?”

“No, but a spell that takes even a full second to cast seems a bit useless in actual combat.”

“Who are you?” she asked, adjusting her glasses. She swept her fingers through her jet-black hair as she finished. “You aren’t one of the church’s dullard initiates, nor are you a scholar. Explorer?”

Arkk wondered if she was basing her assumption on the color of his neck. “I’m self-taught. Just visiting today. But the spells—”

Understanding lit up in her eyes when he mentioned being a visitor. “You just need practice. A deft tongue makes for a deft spell,” she said as if quoting some source.

“But the other spells I know are all short. Each one is just two words.”

“Two…” She blinked a few times, started to laugh, but blinked once more as her eyes widened. “What kind of spells?”

“Well, a lightning bolt spell, a…” Arkk trailed off. The other two short spells he knew, Possession and Summon Lesser Servant were probably not the kinds of spells he should admit to knowing. The former for obvious reasons and the latter because servants were what had the inquisitors snooping about Langleey.

“Can you demonstrate?” the woman asked, not caring that he didn’t finish his explanation.

Arkk glanced around. From experience, he knew that the lightning spell didn’t like a lack of a real target. The room had cleared out during their brief discussion, letting him spot several chairs pressed up against one wall. Seeing nothing better, he pointed to one. “Is it alright if I destroy a chair?”

“Yes, hurry now.”

“Alright. *Electro Deus*,” Arkk said, pointing his hand toward the nearest chair. He pushed just a tiny sliver of magic into the spell. A bolt bridged the distance between him and the chair, slamming into it. It split in two, burning wood chips raining down around the larger seat and back pieces.

He looked back to the woman to find her mouth hanging open, her eyebrows up in her hairline, and her rectangular glasses sliding down the front of her nose.

“Miss?”

She blinked. Her jaw snapped closed. Reaching out, she snatched Arkk’s hand, twisting his arm to see his fingertips. Grabbing one finger, she wiggled it around while asking question after question. “No gesture? Or a thrusting gesture? What was the visualization? Element?”

“Uh—”

“Self-taught. Right. No preconceptions, allowing convention violations?” She clamped one hand under his jaw, yanking his head down to stare directly into Arkk’s eyes. Her face was close enough that their noses almost touched. “Open.”

“What?”

Her fingers pinched into his cheeks, forcing his mouth open. She stared into his open mouth until it got just a bit *too* uncomfortable for Arkk. He pulled back, knocking her hands aside when she tried to grab him again. She hardly seemed offended in the slightest, simply looking down at her hand for a moment before shrugging.

“No time like the present. Short Cast Experiment number one. Lightning bolt visualization, element… storm, obviously. Thrust gesture.” Thrusting a hand toward the next chair, she spoke the incantation. “*Electro Deus*.”

At first, nothing happened. The woman’s intense look of concentration didn’t waver. After a few more seconds, Arkk thought he saw something. It wasn’t a bolt of lightning, that was for sure, just a faint change in the lighting around her palm. If he hadn’t been focused on the woman’s hand, he would have missed it entirely.

He did *not* miss the woman collapsing into a heap on the stage in the very next instant.

## 18 - Explorations and Gambling


Dakka leaned back in her chair, taking a long drink from the hardest ale served in whatever shithole she found herself in. She tried to project an air of casual disregard as she carefully watched the faces around her.

The lizardman with his distinctly inhuman facial features was the hardest to read. His tongue flicked out of his face, tasting the air as his beady yellow eyes looked over his opponents. In contrast, the little fairy girl couldn’t be any more open as she sighed over and over again at the pasteboard cards in her hand. Dakka kept thinking that it was an act, but the fairy lost hand after hand.

The other two, a dark elf with unnaturally gray skin—unnaturally for most other species anyway—and a fellow orc, were much easier to read. Right now, she was reading that the orc didn’t like her all that much. Possibly because of her size, probably because of the large stack of silver she had in front of her that used to be in front of him.

Dakka tossed half a dozen silvers across the table, raising the stakes to the point where the fairy let out a long groan as she threw her cards away. It would have been easy to bait the fairy with a lower bet, but at this point, Dakka was just trying to spare the poor thing from losing any more coin.

The orc across from her, on the other hand… When it looked like he was about to fold as well, Dakka rolled her eyes with an exaggerated scoff. With an angry grunt, the orc tossed in the remainder of his silvers. *Too easy*. The dark elf folded while the lizardman tossed in a few of his rather sizable pile of coins.

Dakka spread her cards on the table. A fairly bad hand, all things considered. The orc let out a guffaw, throwing his cards next to hers while reaching for the pile of silver, only for the lizardman to lash out with a hasty claw.

“Not sso fasst,” the lizardman said, carefully setting his cards down.

A grin spread across Dakka’s face. A grin that only widened once the orc turned a furious expression her way. She might have lost the hand, but reading the lizardman was a victory all on its own. Mostly because it took away the orc’s victory.

She didn’t care about the money the lizardman was sliding over to his side. It wasn’t like it was *her* money. She just cared that the orc was upset. He pissed her off. Now that his pile was completely gone, Dakka stood, dumped the remainder of her coins into her pouch, and waved.

“Thanks for the games, boys. Was a… productive afternoon.” After meeting everyone’s eyes, lingering on the orc’s just a moment longer than everyone else, Dakka turned and left the fine establishment.

She headed down the road, moving alongside the harbor, though a street removed from the seaside, and continued along until she found what she was looking for. A narrow, deserted wynd between two of the rundown wooden buildings of this district. Dakka took the backstreet, stopped halfway through it, and leaned up against the wall.

It didn’t take long before a certain, silverless orc rounded the corner. He paused, startled at her simply waiting there, but quickly balled his hands into fists.

“Tell you what,” Dakka said as he approached. “I have a few questions I want answers to. In exchange, I’ll hand over… let’s say ten of your hard-earned silvers.”

“Scared without your lizard friend here?” he spat. “He won’t be coming to your rescue this time. My boys are watching him.”

Dakka laughed. She had never met that lizardman before. It might have looked like they were conspiring together to ruin this orc. “Should have brought your boys to back you up. Honestly thought there would be at least three of you.”

“Don’t need anyone to teach a runt like you a lesson.”

Dakka’s eye twitched as she ducked his punch. He was wide and obvious. The orc was two heads taller than she was, around the upper end for male orcs. But he wasn’t a fighter. Not a proper fighter, in any case. Not a raider.

Sidestepping another punch, Dakka rammed her fist into his stomach. His knuckles slammed into the side of her head, snapping her neck to the side, but she rolled with it, shimmying around a haymaker. Grabbing hold of his shirt and outstretched arm, Dakka stepped forward, wrapping a leg behind his leg. With it, she lifted him up enough to slam his back down onto the hard flagstone ground.

Dakka kicked her boot into the side of his head once and his shoulders twice as he tried to use the wall to pull himself back up. Bringing her fists together, she hammered down on his head, knocking him down once again.

Grabbing her axe in one hand, Dakka swung straight for his neck. It bit into the wooden wall behind him, sending splinters flying past his face as it stopped just a hair from the side of his green skin.

The orc panted, wide-eyed and sweating. His gaze was off in the corners of his eyes, looking at the edge of the blade without turning his head, as if afraid that even a small movement would have it slice into him.

Dakka grinned. Rearing back, she spat a wad of blood off to the side. “That kind of talk is why you’re silverless,” she said with a grin. Blood was probably staining her teeth. She could feel a little warmth on the side of her head where he had hit her. She might even be bleeding there as well. Dakka expected it to add to the intimidation factor. “Now you’re going to answer my questions. Understand?”

He didn’t answer, too focused on gripping the side of his head where Dakka had kicked him.

“Now,” Dakka said, leaning down. “Tell me everything you know about the Duke and his elf.”

---

Ilya did not meander through the streets, gawking at the compact buildings, stone structures, the fancy fountain in the middle of a *stone* plaza, or even the hundreds upon hundreds of *people* that somehow both fit and lived in such a relatively small space. Exploring wasn’t exactly the word she would use for what she was doing despite what she told Arkk. While she didn’t know exactly where she was going, Ilya moved with purpose.

She had never been this close before.

In the past, as a child, Ilya had dreamed of coming to this city and valiantly rescuing her mother from the Duke. It had been nothing more than that, dreams. Leaving her home alone or even with Arkk on some crusade had always sounded like madness. Now they were here. Ilya, Arkk, and a completely random and unrelated orc. It still sounded like madness that they were going to do *anything*, and yet, things had changed.

Ilya didn’t know where to go, but she knew her destination. She figured that finding it would be easy. All she had to do was follow the wealth. From the district where the majority of the demihumans and beastmen lived to properly maintained wooden buildings and on to stone buildings. When Ilya started to see actual glass in the windows of the surrounding buildings, she knew she was headed in the right direction.

Much to Ilya’s irritation, she found herself stopped before she could reach what she suspected was her destination.

At first, Ilya thought it was a canal. Water filled a relatively wide trough of stone bricks at the end of the street she had been walking on. Walking alongside it, Ilya quickly discovered that it was not just a canal, but a moat. The moat didn’t fully encircle the land beyond but only because part of that land stuck out into the ocean. On the opposite side of the moat was a walled land. Maybe even as large as Langleey Village—the main area including the Baron’s manor, church, and workshops anyway, not the full farmland. There were only two ways across, aside from swimming, and both had guards positioned in front of closed gates.

Walking around for a few more minutes, Ilya came across just what she needed. A three-story building, tall enough to see well over the wall on the other side of the moat. It was right up against the mountainside, which provided the perfect cover as Ilya scaled the wall, finding handholds and footholds in the wide grooves of the stonemasonry.

Ilya pulled herself onto the slanted rooftop made of shale shingles. She took care not to go over the peak, keeping her body firmly on the side that faced away from the moat and walls.

That was it. That *had* to be it. It looked idyllic. A wide open and frankly beautiful vineyard sat beyond the walls, merged with some kind of park-like garden. It stretched on, wrapping around a truly massive, opulent structure in the center of it all. A veritable castle.

The Duke’s manor. Though, calling it a manor implied that it was somehow on the same level as Baron Langleey’s manor and it absolutely was not. Power and prestige permeated every aspect of the construction. The grounds covered the majority of the promontory, jutting out into the sea. The fine building at the center of it all was covered in smooth white stone, not at all like the whitewashed church back in Langleey, where the washing had to be reapplied every few years to keep it gleaming. Here, the stone itself was white. An arching dome made of long panels of clear glass occupied a plot of land about as large as the Langleey church while a high tower at the other end of the keep overlooked the ocean.

Between the moat, the wall, and the wide vineyard, it was as if the Duke were keeping an arm’s length from the unwashed masses of the city he presided over.

People were wandering the grounds. A few guards patrolled the walls and Ilya’s sharp eyes spotted a few more posted in the tall tower but the people on the grounds and in the gardens appeared to be regular people. Gardeners tended to the vineyard.

Others meandered about as well, though not workers. Most were women, dressed in fine robes and gowns. As far as Ilya could tell, they were simply wandering about, enjoying the gardens and the company of each other. Interestingly enough, they weren’t all human.

Arkk had mentioned in the past, hearing tales from the various travelers to the village with whom he loved to talk, that demihumans weren’t often treated well within the Duchy. Ilya hadn’t necessarily believed it. Certainly, no one in Langleey had treated her poorly. Then again, elves supposedly got off lightly compared to some of the more monstrous species. Cliff was evidence enough for her. The way all the demihumans had been shoved off into one little corner of the city, a particularly poor and unkempt corner at that, spoke volumes.

Yet, demihumans were wandering the grounds. They wore fine clothes, no less, not the clothes of serfs or workers. Ilya spotted a dark elf—easily identifiable by her red eyes and long yet more rounded ears—two harpies, a dryad that looked like a walking tangle of bark and vines, a pair of werecats, an orc that, based on the heights of those around it, was even smaller than Dakka, and one other monster that Ilya couldn’t decide if it was a water elemental or a particularly well-formed slime. Of course, there were elves as well. The vast majority of the women wandering the grounds were elves.

There were almost no humans aside from the guards.

Ilya watched from the roof for hours, eyes moving from elf to elf, trying to spot anything familiar on their faces. The people in the bailey meandered about, wandering into the manor and back out. Was that the same orc as before? A werehound joined the small group of beastmen, excitedly running around and annoying the werecats at the same time.

What were all these women doing, just lounging around? Ilya wasn’t sure that she understood. Maybe she just didn’t want to understand, not wanting to think of what it might mean for her mother. If her mother was even there.

Ilya didn’t want to think about what it might mean if her mother *wasn’t* there either.

The sun started to set before Ilya began to stir. She had been watching the manor grounds all day. It was well past time to meet up with Arkk and Dakka. If she delayed much longer, they would probably start panicking.

Just before she could begin climbing down from the roof, however, she heard a loud squawk from the manor grounds.

One of the harpies took off in a sprint, wings flapping. Kicking off the ground with her powerful legs, the harpy launched into the air, much to the alarm of the guards on the walls. Crossbow bolts started flying through the air. While the guards were targeting the harpy in the air, the bolts came down everywhere, forcing everyone on the ground to rush for cover in the safety of the manor.

The harpy did not get very far. It wasn’t even the crossbows that got her. The harpy banked under a volley of bolts, then, as the guards were cranking back their crossbows for another shot, the harpy headed straight over the walls.

A lattice of thin blue lines encapsulated the entire manor, bailey and all. A pair of robe-wearing guards stood in the tall tower at the center of the compound, crouched around a glowing light. Ilya couldn’t see what was glowing from her angle, but she had seen that same light before when Arkk tried to do rituals. The manor had magical protections.

After running into the lattice, the harpy seemed to pass out in mid-air. Her wings, still spread wide, caught the air but the harpy made no effort to stop her tight spiral as she crashed into the ground behind the wall. Ilya winced, wondering if the harpy had survived. She could only barely see the bird-woman, but what she could see wasn’t moving.

Ilya’s eyes were drawn up to the manor where people were once again running out. Guards from the walls made it to the harpy first, but Ilya wasn’t paying attention to them anymore. How could she? Her eyes were locked on a tall, graceful elf striding across the bailey.

An elf with long, silver hair, silver eyes, and sharp ears.

Ilya sucked in a breath.

That was her. Her mother. Alya. She reached the harpy and started saying *something* to the guards. Even though she was practically yelling, Ilya’s sensitive ears heard nothing while she was focused on her mother’s face.

She looked… well. Healthy. Her skin was as flawless as Ilya remembered, with no sign of bruises or abuse. Her arms weren’t scrawny sticks of skin and bone. Although Ilya wasn’t listening to her words, she had a strong voice as she shouted at the guards. It… wasn’t what Ilya had been expecting. In all her nightmares, her mother had been chained up in a deep dungeon, shackled to the walls, and fed little more than barley water. In the better nightmares, Ilya and Arkk charged in with a sword and bow, chopping down guards as they worked to free her.

In her focus on her mother, Ilya completely missed someone else approaching the guards and the fallen harpy. It wasn’t until he grabbed Alya by the waist that Ilya took notice.

He was short, especially next to Alya, with large bulging eyes like those of a frog. Dressed in the finest clothes that Ilya had ever seen, he wore a velvety black and red lounge jacket with particularly bright red lapels. Every finger on both his hands was adorned with gold bands and colorful gemstones. A large blue and white striped shield emblem hung proudly off his chest, surrounded by filigree while a winged lion stood on its hind legs in the center.

Duke Levi Woldair.

It had to be him. Ilya had never seen the man before, but the moment she put her eyes on his slimy grin, she knew it had to be him.

Ilya’s hand moved to her back where her mother’s bow was locked in its clasps. He was *right* there. Right in front of her. Standing out in the open. From her elevated position, it would be too easy to end him right now.

Before she could fully unclasp her bow from her back, her movements made it scrape against the shale tiles of the roof. Ilya froze solid at the noise, not daring to move. Even though it had been a faint scrape, it sounded like thunder to her sharp ears.

The humans across the moat didn’t react in the slightest as they continued to speak to one another. Her mother, however, snapped her gaze up. She looked around for just a moment before her gaze landed on Ilya. Her eyes widened for a bare instant before narrowing into a thin glare. She kept her gaze on Ilya long enough to mouth a single word.

“*Leave*.”

As soon as she said that, she adopted a forced smile and leaned down, whispering something into the Duke’s ear. Whatever it was, the Duke let out a laugh and waved off his guards. One guard, who Ilya now realized had a loaded crossbow aimed at the harpy’s head, pulled back as two others moved to grab the harpy by the wings. They dragged her off toward the manor.

The Duke followed and Ilya’s mother fell in line just behind him, putting herself between Ilya and the Duke.

It was another hour, well after sunset, before Ilya dared to climb down from her perch. Neither the Duke nor her mother returned from the manor. Most of the others Ilya had seen over the day remained inside as well. Only the guards stayed out, returning to their posts around the walls and towers. After the excitement with the harpy, they remained on alert, but that slowly died down.

Ilya drifted through a haze as she made her way back to the Primrose. She couldn’t believe what she had seen.

Ilya clenched her teeth, fingers digging into the palms of her tightly clenched fists. Her mother was protecting the Duke? Why? And that glare… The first time she saw Ilya in fifteen years and she *glared*? Ilya couldn’t understand it. In all her worst nightmares, she had never seen *that* reaction. She had been prepared to find her mother battered and broken, used and abused in ways that Ilya didn’t even want to think about. And yet…

“There you are!”

Ilya blinked, realizing that she had made it back to the Primrose. Dakka sat at one of the tables, a half-burned cigar in one hand and a spread of pasteboard cards in the other. The orc dropped her cards on the table, face down, and scooped a rather large pile of coins into her pouch as she stood, much to the disappointed looks of those she was sharing a table with.

“You look like shit,” Dakka said, picking up an orc-sized flagon full of beer from the table and marching right over to Ilya. “Drink?”

Ilya stared at the orc for a moment. Alcohol wasn’t her favorite thing in the world, beer even less. Yet, right now… She reached out and took the tall mug. Tipping it back, she started drinking and didn’t stop until there was nothing left.

For some inane reason, people around her let out a laughing cheer when she finished.

“Jeeze,” Dakka said as Ilya shoved the empty mug back over. “Don’t know what happened to you, but I might have some good news to cheer you back up.”

“Good news?”

Dakka glanced around, dropped the flagon on the nearest table, then motioned toward the stairs up to the second floor. “Not here.”

“Right…”

Ilya followed after Dakka, feeling everything she just drank slosh around in her otherwise empty stomach. She hadn’t eaten anything since morning, having stayed up on that rooftop all day. About halfway up, she thought she might wind up sick, but managed to steady herself before continuing. It helped that Dakka clapped a hand to her back, steadying her.

“So,” Dakka said as they stepped into their room. “It turns out the Duke has a lot of monsters in his… *collection*.”

“Yeah. I noticed.”

“Noticed?”

Ilya shook her head as she slumped onto the bed, motioning with her hand for Dakka to continue.

“Well, he has many elves,” Dakka said, sounding a little less certain of her supposed good news. “Word is that he treats them very well.”

“Oh.” Ilya might have been happy to hear that earlier, but now? Did the Duke treat them well enough that her own mother would trade her for his company? She felt nausea welling inside her at the thought.

Or maybe that was the alcohol.

“If that doesn’t cheer you up,” Dakka said, hesitating a moment as she watched Ilya. “The Duke holds monthly parties at his manor where he shows off his *collection* to all the important people in the city.”

Ilya blinked, looking up while slowly shaking her head. “Is that supposed to make me happy?”

“I thought that, with you and Arkk planning on pretending to be some important people, you might make it into his manor for one of these parties.”

It took a moment for the words to hit her, but when they did, Ilya sat up straight. She nodded her head, slowly at first, then faster and faster. “Yes. We could get in and I could ask…” Ilya trailed off, a lump forming in her throat.

“In addition to parties, I hear he auctions some of them off on occasion.”

“Auctions?” Ilya said, nose wrinkling.

“Disgusting, yeah. The Duchy officially has a bounty on any slavers. Apparently *owning* slaves isn’t against any decrees.” Dakka shrugged as if the notion didn’t bother her much. It was just the way things were. “With your goal, however…”

Ilya’s eyes widened. “You’re right. Right, we just need to,” Ilya said, standing, then she looked around. She squinted, the room was dark, but it was obvious that only she and Dakka were inside. “Where is Arkk?”

Dakka shrugged. “No idea. Haven’t seen him since this morning.”

“He was the one who insisted we be back before sunset.”

“*I* was back,” Dakka said, tone implying that she had been the only one to follow that particular plan.

“Oh no. I feel like he’s gotten himself into another mess…” Ilya said, staggering over to the window. “I hope he hasn’t made anything explode.”

“Or anyone.”

Ilya grimaced. Memories of the orc chieftain’s grim fate were too much for her, making her lean over the windowsill.

She ignored Dakka griping about the waste of good beer.

## 19 - The Inquisition of The Light


Arkk sat on a bench outside the recovery ward of Cliff’s academy. He had run out to get help the moment the woman—Zullie, he had discovered—collapsed. A few students and instructors had come, picked her up, and carried her off to the recovery ward. He should have left while they were busy and not paying attention to him, but two things were keeping him at the academy.

First, he hadn’t accomplished anything he had come here to do. All he had learned was one spell that he couldn’t remember after having heard its long incantation only once. Secondly, well, he felt guilty. That woman had collapsed after having tried to cast his spell. He had no idea why. None of what Vezta instilled in his mind with the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE] gave him any clue as to what had happened to Zullie.

Still, he should have left. He could have come back in the morning. They were planning on spending three days in Cliff, plenty of time to visit again and both look into the matter of books and check up on Zullie.

He should have left.

He knew he should have left the moment he spotted a familiar face walking down the academy corridor. Arkk should only know two other faces in the entire city and this was neither.

The man’s head practically scraped the ceiling of the corridors. His posture, head slightly ahead of the rest of his body and arms straight at his side without swinging as he moved, triggered all kinds of unease in Arkk. The worst was his smile. It looked calm and serene, but the stiffness and the way his lips were parted just enough to see his upper teeth didn’t help Arkk’s disquiet.

He walked right past Arkk, reaching for the door handle with his long arms, but paused the moment he touched the metal. With a faint sniff, he turned his head.

There was a slight, awkward pause as recognition lit up behind those thin round glasses. “Ah. Mister Arkk,” he said in the same tone someone might use when greeting an old friend.

Arkk held in a sigh. “Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox. Right?”

“You remembered.”

“Well, you made an impression, I guess.”

His smile deepened without reaching his eyes for a bare instant before he returned to a placid expression. “Fancy encountering you here. Did you recall something you wished to tell us?”

“No, I…” Arkk trailed off as the Master Inquisitor stepped closer, utterly dwarfing him as he remained in his seat. “I remembered what you said about learning at a magical academy and decided to come to take a look for myself.”

“Enjoying yourself so far?”

“I didn’t really get a chance to look around before the first person I tried to talk to collapsed,” Arkk said with a glance at the closed door.

“I heard an old colleague of mine suffered some sort of magical malady,” Vrox said, looking toward the door. “Now that I’ve found you here, many questions come to mind.”

“As much as I would love to answer them,” Arkk started, sliding to the side on the bench so he could stand without bumping into Vrox. “I was only sticking around to make sure Zullie was alright, but if someone as qualified as you is here—”

“Stay,” Vrox said, taking a step to the side to keep in front of Arkk. “Tell me what you did.”

“Why do you think I did anything?”

“Because you are here,” Vrox said, smile slipping entirely. “And, Mister Arkk, I do not trust you. I do not believe a word you say. From the moment we met, you have done nothing but lie to me.”

“But I didn’t—”

“Another lie.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, glaring. “Then I suppose there is no point in telling you anything, is there? If you aren’t going to believe a word I say, why waste my breath?”

Darius Vrox stared, then smiled his stiff, open-mouthed grin once again. “Well, shall we see how our unfortunate professor is handling herself?” he asked, stepping to the door. Without even waiting for Arkk’s response, he turned the handle and pushed the door open.

Arkk glanced down the corridor. This was his chance to escape. Yet, if he ran away now, he was sure that Vrox would see that as a sign of further guilt. Arkk still wasn’t sure exactly what the inquisitors wanted, but Olatt’an, Vezta, and Ilya all said that having them after him would be irritating at best, but more likely deadly.

Not to mention, he did want to know if Zullie was alright.

With a sigh, feeling again like he should just leave, Arkk followed Vrox into the recovery ward.

Cliff Academy Recovery Ward was a fairly subdued affair. There was a large desk with a larger shelf behind it. Dozens of stoppered glass bottles occupied the spaces, each a different size, shape, and with different colored liquids inside. Between the shelf and the desk, a woman sat wearing white robes almost identical to those worn by Abbess Keena in Langleey. Her clothes covered her entire body except for her face and her hands.

Beyond the desk, several beds were pushed up against the wall. Three of the five were unoccupied. One had a younger man with bloodied bandages wrapped around one arm. Zullie was in the other, asleep and unharmed save for the large bruise that had spread across her chin and cheek on one side of her face.

Another man stood over her bed. He wore a long white cassock with a little black square at the center of his collar. There was no doubt that this man was a member of the Abbey of the Light; the golden thread woven into his cassock formed the same symbols that adorned Abbess Keena’s habit and the church buildings.

“Priest,” Vrox said, stepping up to the foot of the bed.

“Who—” The priest looked up from Zullie. His eyes widened to their maximum and he took a hesitant step back. “M-Ma—”

“Darius Vrox, at your service.”

“Master Inquisitor!”

“Please,” Vrox said with his utterly insincere smile, “call me Darius.” His eyes shifted down to Zullie and his smile disappeared. “What happened to the female?”

“Your Eminence!” the priest shouted, back stiffening. “This is hardly a matter that warrants your attention.”

“I will be the judge of that.”

“Of course, Sir.” The priest glanced downward, frowning at the woman on the bed. “It’s just Zullie. One of our premier spell researchers. Except, she doesn’t know when to stop. She has overloaded her magical channels. Again. A bit of rest and she’ll be back on her feet.”

“This is a frequent occurrence?”

“Oh yes. This happens… once a month at the very least.”

“Once a month?” Arkk said. “It isn’t anything serious?”

The priest jolted, glancing at Arkk as if it were the first time he noticed that anyone else was in the room. With a slight glance to Vrox, who didn’t move in the slightest, the priest nodded his head. “I wouldn’t say it *isn’t* serious, but it is hardly unusual for Zullie. You’re the one who brought her here? I didn’t realize you were waiting around.”

Arkk sighed. “I should have left. I was worried for nothing.”

Scratching the back of his head, the priest offered a half-hearted shrug. Looking back to the inquisitor, he stiffened and cleared his throat. “I offered a prayer of rejuvenation as well as administered a phial of replenishment. There is no need to concern yourself, Sir.”

“On the contrary, I find myself quite concerned when one of our esteemed oracles begins a Prognosis stating that the stars have begun aligning within Cliff Magical Academy.”

“*Inside*?” Arkk said, frowning. He grimaced at having accidentally drawn the inquisitor’s attention but pressed his lips together and continued when no one said anything to him. “Don’t you mean above? How are stars aligning inside a mountain?”

Vrox fixed Arkk with a long look. Long enough that Arkk felt himself fidgeting under the taller man’s gaze. “Where is the horror from beyond the stars, Mister Arkk?”

“This again,” Arkk mumbled with a sigh. “I haven’t even seen that monster in… over a week at least,” he said, once again implying one thing without lying. Thinking back to what Vezta had said, he asked, “What does that even mean, *beyond* the stars?”

“Mister Arkk, I understand that you are a lowly countryside creature ignorant of the ways of the world and, I’m sure, most *everything* save for farming and what few scraps of magic you might have gleaned from the pages of passers-by.”

Arkk waited for the ‘but’ to follow that extended insult.

It never came.

“The Inquisition of the Light exists to protect the world and all its inhabitants from things *beyond*,” Vrox continued. “A mine infested by gorgon or a necromancer commanding an army of thousands is mere child’s play compared to what I have personally seen. The things we deal with threaten the very *concept* of life; the average being we hunt down is unimaginable to the majority of humans. And yet, I believe you, in all your ignorance, would imagine one such being quite well.”

“If you’re talking about Vezta,” Arkk said with a scowl, “then I told you in Langleey. She showed up and helped defend the village. So obviously I can imagine her. But we almost got overwhelmed by a hundred goblins. I would be *far* more scared of a necromancer with an army. Besides, she helped the village. Saved us, even. An enemy of life itself or whatever wouldn’t have done that. You’re clearly barking up the wrong tree.”

Vrox took a deep breath, staring. His smile snapped back into place. “Possible,” he said, turning away from the bed. “But unlikely given the description we received. And now, I find you at the site of the oracle’s Prognosis. There is a limit to coincidence, Mister Arkk.” He dipped his head. “Please inform any member of the Abbey of the Light should you recall anything of *interest* regarding your monster. We may be mistaken. Finding the creature and examining it would put our worries to rest. Good day, Mister Arkk.”

Arkk watched the tall man duck through the doorway and turn down the hall.

Now, he decided *not* to leave. Not yet, anyway. Let the inquisitor get far away before he followed. The last thing Arkk wanted to do was carry on their conversation on the way out. Or worse, walk along in awkward silence. Instead, Arkk turned back to Zullie and the priest.

The priest was breathing hard, half collapsed onto the adjacent bed. His face was flushed and he kept patting his chest.

“Are you alright?” Arkk asked, not wanting to be responsible for a *second* person fainting in his presence today.

“Oh dear me. I’m…” He pressed his lips together, breathing out. One more breath in and he seemed to calm himself down. “Not every day you run into an *inquisitor*, is it? Not to speak ill of His Eminence, but I am glad he is gone. Ill omens follow in their wake. I hope he doesn’t return.”

“Ill omens?”

“As he said, inquisitors hunt dangerous creatures and forbidden magics. If an inquisitor is snooping about, one of those things is certainly present.” The priest glanced down at Zullie. “I hope you haven’t been delving into dangerous research. Again,” he mumbled under his breath. “Sorry. Just a bit shook is all. You mentioned that you were from Langleey?”

“You’ve heard of it?” Arkk asked, surprised. He had been telling people he came from Smilesville after the first few people had no idea where Langleey was.

“The abbess in charge is still Keena, correct?” At Arkk’s nod, he smiled. “Keena and I were initiates and, later, acolytes at the same time. Tell her Heller says hello. I haven’t seen her in years.”

“Sure, I’m sure she’d be happy—”

Zullie’s eyes snapped open as she gasped in her bed. The gasp turned into a rickety cough that ended with her leaning over the side of the bed. Arkk thought she was going to be sick for a moment, but she ended up only spitting out a small wad of blood onto the floor.

“Zullie! *Please*,” Heller said, pinching his nose. “I’ve told you time and time again and now you’re dirtying my ward—”

“Ugh, *here* again,” Zullie groaned, smacking herself in the face. “Glasses. Where are my glasses, old man?”

“I am *not* old.”

“You’re twice my age, almost three times,” Zullie said. She patted her hands around the bedside table until her fingers found the square rims of her glasses. She tried to put them on, only to hiss as she jabbed herself right in her bruise. With a finger, she tenderly prodded at it, feeling for the edges of the injury.

“I applied some poultice. You’ll probably be tender for a good week.”

“Great.” Zullie carefully slid the glasses onto her face, taking special care not to bump her cheek. “How long…” She trailed off as she looked around the room. “You!”

“Sorry,” Arkk said with a grimace. “I didn’t know—”

“How did you do that?”

“Uh…”

Against the protests of the priest, Zullie jumped out of her bed, lunging for Arkk. He started to back up, moving out of reach of her grab, only to watch her legs fail her. Arkk stepped forward quickly, managing to catch her before she could crash to the floor again.

“You need rest, Zullie,” Heller said, moving around the bed to help.

“I don’t need rest.” She fought him off, grabbing hold of Arkk by the shoulders and pulling herself far too close for comfort.

What was it with these people and their lack of personal boundaries?

“You!” Zullie said again. “How? I poured *everything* I had into that and couldn’t manage a spark!”

Arkk shrugged. “You were talking about elements and gestures? Maybe you got the wrong ones.”

“No. Something should have happened.”

“You collapsed.”

She *glared*.

“Uh… there was a slight flash of light? Nothing too bright. It might have been my imagination, honestly.”

Releasing him, Zullie pinched her chin between her thumb and forefinger. “So, it did work,” she mumbled to herself. “But…”

As the magical researcher began mumbling to herself about various magical theories that Arkk couldn’t make heads or tails of, he started backing away. Slowly at first, but once he got to the door, he picked up his pace. He really should have left a long time ago. There would surely be others around who could point him to a bookstore. Maybe even Hawkwood. Surely a mercenary company made use of spellcasters in their ranks.

Arkk didn’t make it very far before he heard the woman running up from behind. She had barely been able to stand a moment ago and now she was running? Arkk had to give her points for determination if nothing else.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Zullie shouted as she closed the distance.

“Thought you needed your rest,” Arkk said with a wan smile as he turned around.

“What I *need* is to figure out how you did that spell. Show me again.”

Arkk sighed. “Before you go pass out again, would you mind telling me where I can pick up some books on magic? Both rituals and incantations, please.”

“You want books after showing me *that*? If I knew where to find a book that could teach me to cast a spell in two words, you think I’d be in this dump? I would be living large as the King’s court sorcerer!”

“Well, I would still like some books. And I have no idea how to teach you that spell. The way I learned it…” Arkk pressed his lips together. “It was unorthodox, to say the least. And some people might be after the person who taught me.”

“The inquisitor?” Zullie asked, violet eyes piercing through her glasses. “I was half-awake throughout all that. Caught part of it, I think.” She stepped back, crossing her arms with a thoughtful expression on her face. “Forbidden magic, huh? Inquisitors don’t roll out of bed for a soul-splitting lich and you’ve got them in a tizzy over a little lightning bolt?”

“I think they’re after the person who taught it,” Arkk repeated.

“Only because they don’t know about the spell. Did you ever demonstrate it for them?”

“No.”

“Don’t. I’ll teach you a proper spell for a lightning bolt if they ever show up asking to know.”

Arkk raised his eyebrows. “You’ll help me? Even if I’ve got these inquisitors buzzing over my shoulder?”

Zullie stared at him, eyes locked on his. “There is nothing I value more than the pursuit of magical advancement. A two-word lightning spell of that caliber… To be honest, it puts every accomplishment under my name to shame.”

“Sorry.”

She shook her head. “It’s wonderful. Fascinating. So, you teach me your spell or bring me to your tutor and I teach you how to better hide from the inquisitors. They are non-too-pleased with me, to be honest. I have experience dealing with them. How does that sound?”

“Well, I…” Arkk trailed off, frowning. “Well, I need to be careful making transactional agreements like that. You might end up getting hired by accident.”

“Hired?”

Arkk shook his head, waving his hand dismissively. He was sure she would be interested in *that* as well given that the [HEART] was some ancient magical artifact. With her as excited as she was about the lightning spell, he didn’t want to alarm—or excite—her any further.

“My companions and I were only going to be in the city for another few days before we return home. We are planning on coming back sometime soon, but I don’t know about bringing Vezta—”

“How many more days?”

“Two or three.”

“I’ll have my things packed and ready.”

Arkk stared. “Excuse me?”

“I can pay my way for food and sleeping accommodations. Transit too, if necessary.”

“You’re coming with us?”

“Yes,” Zullie said, straight-faced and entirely serious. “Is that a problem?”

“I guess not.” He would double-check with Ilya and Dakka, but he doubted they would mind. And if she was going to help him with the inquisitors, then keeping her happy would be for the best. “I don’t know exactly when we’re going to leave. Stop by the Primrose stayover tomorrow night and we’ll have a better idea.”

“Primrose,” she said, nose wrinkling.

“Is that a problem?”

“No, no. I suppose not.” Nodding to herself, she straightened her back. Arms still crossed, she angled one upward and gestured vaguely with her fingers. “I will be there. Tomorrow evening, before sunset.”

“Great. I’ll let the others know,” Arkk said, backing away once again.

For a long few moments, he thought she might chase after him, but she didn’t. Zullie remained right where she was, tapping her finger against her chin while muttering to herself. Satisfied that he wasn’t about to be tackled, Arkk began the long process of figuring out where to find the exit to the maze of interconnected corridors.

It did remind him of Fortress Al-Mir in that regard, though he had never found himself lost back home. The fortress projected a map into his mind and he could teleport anywhere at will within. The same was not true here.

Eventually, he found someone else wandering the halls who was happy to show him the way out.

When he saw the night sky hanging overhead, Arkk winced.

“The others are going to kill me,” he mumbled.

## 20 - Viscount Wesley


“She didn’t even look at me. The moment she realized who I was, she turned away. Not once did she even pretend to glance back.”

“Did you expect her to start shouting and waving? Pointing out the elf on the rooftop about to attack the Duke?” Arkk said with a shake of his head. “I can’t believe you were about—”

Ilya cut him off. “I *wasn’t*.”

“What else were you grabbing your bow for?”

“I just… nothing,” she said through her teeth. “I don’t want to talk about it. Not unless we’re talking about how to get into one of the Duke’s parties.”

“Could always put Ilya up for auction,” Dakka said as they walked along one of the fancier roads in the city.

“No, no,” Arkk said, shooting the orc a look. Then he turned a glare on Ilya, who looked to be considering the possibility. “Getting in is only part of the problem. We have to get back out too, with Alya. From what you said, how close she seemed to the duke, it doesn’t sound like she is likely to be sold off at an auction.”

“So,” Ilya said, looking to Arkk, “how do we do it?”

“Magic. Maybe… I’m a bit wary about those magical defenses you said the manor had. If those interfere with Vezta’s teleportation circles, we’ll have to find another route.” Arkk shrugged. “I’ll ask her when we return. We’ve confirmed that Alya is safe and isn’t being harmed. That means we have time to figure it out. No need to rush in there without a plan. In any case, what we’re doing now may or may not help. Not sure. I was planning on doing this anyway.” Arkk glanced around, then dropped his voice to a lower register. “Let’s avoid discussing Alya for now.”

“What *are* we doing?” Dakka asked, looking around with a frown. “I don’t know about you two, but several people we’ve passed have been staring. I’m not sure I’m welcome in this section of the city.”

Arkk had noticed the stares as well. They were far from the only ones out and about. In contrast to the area around the Primrose, people here had a much more obvious wealth and a pampered air to them. They were also, by and large, human. The number of demihumans they had passed in the last ten minutes of walking could be counted on one hand. It was… odd. The Duke had a whole manor filled with demihumans and beastmen, yet in the wider city, they were treated poorly.

It made Arkk wonder what the three of them looked like walking down the street. He and Ilya both had their fine clothes on, but she wasn’t bothering to hide her ears at the moment. Dakka, lacking fancy clothes from the fortress tailor servant, had her normal metal armor on with her shield attached to her back and her axe slung against her hip. Would they look like two well-to-do sorts walking around with an orc bodyguard or could the people they were passing simply *tell* that they weren’t as affluent as they were pretending to be?

Unconsciously, Arkk rubbed at the back of his neck.

Luckily, they were almost there. Arkk turned through a small black-metal archway to a building that looked like it could have been a fortress of its own. Not like Fortress Al-Mir, but something akin to the garrison in the city. Strong, thick walls, a heavy wooden door reinforced with iron, and a long path between the gate and the building where people might rain arrows down on intruders.

Today, Arkk wasn’t an intruder but an invited guest. Though, being invited still meant he was asked to stand around outside while the men in white tabards with black chevrons went to fetch their commander. Expecting Arkk to arrive, it didn’t take long for Hawkwood to step outside with a smile on his face. He took in both Ilya and Dakka without losing that smile, then stepped forward with a hand extended.

“Mister Arkk, glad you made it.”

“Hawkwood,” Arkk said, taking his hand. He then motioned to his left and right. “This is Ilya, my… second in command? And Dakka. She’s the… uh… field commander for the orcs I mentioned having in my employ,” he said, faltering with introducing their duties. It wasn’t something he had thought about until this moment, but just introducing them as Dakka and Ilya felt lacking.

“You really are new to this, aren’t you?” Hawkwood said with a hearty laugh. Though his smile remained in place, his tone turned far more serious as he continued speaking. “It does make me wonder how you secured their loyalty.”

Arkk hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. He had deliberately avoided mentioning Fortress Al-Mir and its powers during his earlier explanation of events.

Dakka, however, came to his rescue with a casual shrug. “Most of us were already displeased with the way things were going. Arkk offered an alternative that kept our heads from a chopping block along with the possibility for meaningful jobs.” She shrugged again then looked down to Arkk. “Though if you have us farming again, you only have yourself to blame for desertions.”

Hawkwood clapped his hands together a few times, laughing all the while. “No farm work today,” he said, giving Dakka a companionable thwack against her armbrace. “Might not find it much more exciting, mind, but it isn’t farming.”

“Where are you taking us?” Arkk asked.

“One of those jobs you were looking at the other day was for tracking down a missing daughter. Remember that? Still interested?”

“That’s… part of the reason for that is that I know a tracking ritual. But I’m not sure that I should use it on anyone I don’t want harmed. It has a… dangerous component to it.”

“Huh.” Hawkwood crossed his arms.

“Sorry, I didn’t know—”

“No matter. The appointment has already been made. We’re meeting with Viscount Wesley now. He is waiting inside.”

“We’re, excuse me, we’re meeting with a viscount?” Ilya asked, startled out of her morose thoughts, bringing her into the conversation for the first time since Hawkwood walked out. “*Arkk*,” she hissed, turning toward him.

“Nothing to worry about. Viscount Wesley is a serious man who takes his duties to the Duchy with the utmost decorum expected of a man in his station. However, since his daughter’s disappearance, he has been increasingly disturbed. Someone, *anyone*, offering even the hope that they are looking for his daughter will go a great way toward helping him from his depression.”

“You haven’t offered to help?” Arkk asked Hawkwood. He tried not to sound accusatory, but if the situation was as dire as it sounded, surely he could offer assistance.

The knight shook his head. “White Company isn’t exactly that kind of mercenary group. We’re under a direct charter from the Duke himself, effectively acting as a supplementary army to the guards of the realm. A single individual going missing, while tragic, is outside the purview of our contracted duties. To be more accurate, we *cannot* take on other contracts without the express permission of Duke Woldair.”

“I see…”

“But nothing is preventing me from introducing the Viscount to an up-and-coming mercenary group like yours. Come along,” he said, turning back to the White Company headquarters. Right before he reached the door, he paused and looked back. “You never mentioned a name for your group. I presume you are not registered with the realm—I can help backdate that if you wish—but having a name is important. It grants legitimacy and helps to spread reputation among anyone interested in the services of mercenaries.”

Arkk hadn’t spent any more time considering what to call his group than he had what to call Ilya and Dakka. His first thought was of Fortress Al-Mir. He couldn’t call them *Fortress* Al-Mir, but perhaps Al-Mir? It sounded like it needed something more. From his earlier meeting with Hawkwood, he had heard of a few other mercenary groups. White Company, of course, and then there was the Veridian Guard, a smaller group that specialized in taking down nefarious spellcasters, the Flying Dragons, a group of beastmen—none of whom were dragons or even dragonkin according to Hawkwood—that primarily served as bodyguards to wealthy individuals who could afford their unique skills, and the Grand Company, soldiers leftover from the War of Kings who sold their services to the highest bidder. They all had two words in their names.

“Company Al-Mir?” Arkk wasn’t sure that felt right, but put on the spot like this?

“Al-Mir?” Hawkwood asked.

“It has meaning to us,” Arkk said, not wanting to divulge anything more about the fortress. Perhaps he shouldn’t have even mentioned the name.

Not that it looked like Hawkwood noticed. With a shrug and a quirk of his head, he opened the door and led the group through a short hallway before they arrived at a small conference room. It was a surprisingly grandiose affair. Thick, cushioned furniture, large portraits over the mantle above a fireplace, a small table set out with colored confections that Arkk had never seen before, and the man himself.

Viscount Wesley was every bit as opulent as Arkk would expect from a viscount. Arkk didn’t know exactly what viscounts *did*, but that they had a title at all meant they were people of importance. The man wore a slick black suit with red accents, far nicer than Arkk’s attire, and had perfectly styled white hair slicked back over his head. With gloved hands, he lifted an ornate teacup to his mouth and started to take a sip. He paused as soon as he noticed the door opening.

As Arkk entered, with Ilya and Dakka behind him, he noted Wesley’s nose wrinkle as if a foul stench had followed them into the room. Casting his gaze on the teacup, which received an undeserved look of disgust, he set the cup down on the table and placed his hands on the knee of his crossed legs.

“Viscount Wesley,” Hawkwood said, striding into the room with perfect confidence. He offered a slight bow then gestured back. “May I present Mister Arkk, Ilya, and Dakka of Company Al-Mir.”

Arkk ducked his head at his introduction, as did Ilya. Dakka didn’t. The Viscount simply sat still for a long moment before he nodded his head.

“Charmed,” he said, the word coming out in a slow drawl where he never quite parted his teeth.

“Good afternoon, Viscount,” Arkk said with a slightly more respectful bow. It felt gross doing so. Unnatural. Made all the worse by the fact that this certainly did not look like a man fearing for his lost daughter. “I understand you had a daughter go missing?”

“Missing?” Viscount Wesley ground his teeth together, clenching one of his hands into a fist. “She was *kidnapped*!”

“Kidnapped?” “Kidnapped?”

Arkk and Hawkwood spoke at the same time, glancing at each other immediately after. Deferring to his experience in mercenary endeavors, Arkk waited for him to speak first.

“The notice posted on the garrison said—”

“I know what it says. The—” Wesley’s eyes flicked to Ilya then back to Hawkwood. “—*person* taking my statement did not comprehend what I was saying. Gretchen is not so clumsy as to fail to find her way back home, nor would she simply abandon her comfortable life in the manor. The girl was kidnapped. Stolen.”

“Do you have suspects or leads? Any news of ransoms or…” Hawkwood curled his lip in disgust. “Or marriages?”

“No. No to all three questions,” Wesley said. He pressed his thumb and middle finger to either side of his eyebrows, shading his eyes as he sighed. “It has been eight days. I have not seen hide nor hair of Gretchen or her abductors. I commissioned the Jarman Guild with seeking her out, but I’ve not heard from them either. I know not whether they perished or simply took my down payment and fled.”

Arkk made a note to ask Hawkwood about this Jarman Guild later on. Hawkwood would know if they were reputable or if they were the kinds of people to take advantage of a viscount.

“We won’t require any kind of down payment, Sir,” Arkk said, taking over during the moment of silence.

“No down payment?” Wesley asked, lowering his hand to show off slightly watery eyes. He was at least a little broken up about his daughter being gone. “It offends me that you think I need *charity*.”

Arkk mentally retracted his assumption that the man was broken up. “You’ll pay in full when you have your daughter back,” Arkk said, voice firm. “Until then, why not start with a description of your daughter?”

Wesley narrowed his eyes. After a brief glance to Hawkwood, who nodded his head, the Viscount sighed. “Dark skin, dark eyes… face similar to my own without the beard. Her hair is white as well, though a bit curly. The color runs in the family. The curls came from her mother.” The man took a deep, slightly trembly breath, then added, “She has a fondness for the color green. I believe she was wearing green the night she was taken. More went missing along with her. A silver broach, in particular, with a large emerald embedded in the front.”

Appreciating Hawkwood correcting his lack of foresight by handing over a paper and inkwell, Arkk scribbled down everything Wesley said. He almost asked the Viscount if he knew where his daughter might be, but stopped himself at the last moment. While he thought the intended meaning would be obvious, the Viscount’s temperament was already volatile. It wouldn’t surprise Arkk to hear him grouse about pedantry.

Instead, Arkk asked, “Do you have any starting places for where a search might commence?”

“Three days after she was gone, when I realized she was missing, I sought a spellcaster from the academy. This isn’t the first time Gretchen has been kidnapped. Previously, the spellcasters were able to help locate her through arcane means, but this time it failed. It seems as if she traveled too far away.”

“They tried a tracking ritual?” Arkk asked with a wince. Hawkwood shot him a sympathetic look.

“I am no spellcaster, nor do I care to be one, Mister Arkk. I don’t know what they did, only what the results were.”

Arkk sighed. Scratch one plan before it could even start. At least he didn’t have to begin the awkward task of asking the man for a piece of his missing daughter.

“The only real clue I have is what the Jarman Guild reported to me before they stopped sending missives. Someone matching the description of my daughter was spotted in some backwater called Darkwood.”

“Darkwood?” Arkk asked, frowning. The name sounded familiar. There was only one place he would have heard the name before and that was from people passing through Langleey. Mercenaries and bounty hunters.

“A burg to the east,” Hawkwood said. “Not a very reputable place. It exports rare wood but always has some necromancer or sorcerer with delusions of grandeur trying to make trouble in the woods.”

Arkk nodded his head as he wrote the name down on the piece of paper. “Any other information you might think pertinent?”

The Viscount stared a long moment before standing. “Mister Hawkwood. Thank you for the tea. It was… *passible*.” With that, he strode right past Arkk, Ilya, and Dakka without looking at any of them and left the room.

Arkk drew in a long breath and let it out slowly. He looked away from the closed door, meeting Ilya’s eyes. He could easily see the exasperation in her gaze, the same exasperation he felt. Looking back to Hawkwood, finding the man smiling as if nothing about that confrontation had bothered him, Arkk tried to think of something diplomatically polite to say.

“If that man is upset about losing his daughter, I’ll eat my axe,” Dakka said before Arkk could speak.

Hawkwood laughed, but it seemed more forced than his earlier displays of humor. “It isn’t the first time Gretchen has, pardon me for saying, *run away*. There have been three instances in the past, all of which he claimed were abductions, one of which seemed to be an abduction. Whatever the case is this time, he is at least somewhat numb to the frequent occurrences.

“Rest assured, to someone who knows him, he is acting unusual. Worried and frightened in his own way.”

Arkk nodded, deciding to avoid asking *what* the man was worried about. Instead, he took the top sheet of paper, left the rest on the table, then stood. “Well, whatever his feelings are, his daughter *is* missing. I don’t know if we’ll be able to do anything about it, but we can certainly try.”

## 21 - Departure


“Dakka,” Arkk said under his breath. “Are you aware that there are about eight demihumans following us?”

Arkk could see his employees wherever they were, in the fortress or out here in Cliff. He could see a little bit of the area around his employees as well. At least while outside the fortress. For those inside Fortress Al-Mir, he could see *everything* if he focused. It was an odd sort of vision. A bit like going cross-eyed from drinking too much, except instead of seeing two of whatever was in front of him, he saw whatever he was focused on.

Out here, in the periphery of Dakka, he could see several orcs, a lizardman, and two elves following some distance behind as he walked along the streets with Dakka at his side.

They had been following them since they left the Primrose.

“Cowards and weaklings,” Dakka said with a huff, glancing over her shoulder. As she did so, most of those following stopped and tried to look busy with anything else. That just had her scoffing. “I recognize a few of them. People I’ve been gambling with lately.”

“Have you been cheating?” Arkk asked, mildly exasperated.

“Hardly.”

“So, a little.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Dakka said with a grunt. “We can take them.”

“I don’t *want* to take them,” Arkk hissed. “The inquisitors are already breathing down my neck. If I start throwing around forbidden magic—”

“Didn’t your new minion teach you a different lightning spell?”

“She isn’t a minion. *You’re* not a minion.” Ignoring Dakka’s scoff, Arkk continued, “She did, but I don’t think a seventeen-syllable spell that can only produce one bolt of lightning per incantation is actually valid for combat. How do other spellcasters do it?”

“Ask your new minion,” Dakka said with a shrug as they kept walking along the road. “Plans for the group behind us?”

“Stay out of dingy alleys? They won’t attack us in the open, will they?”

“They’ll probably stick around, keeping watch until we return. Jump us on the way back.” Dakka paused, then added, “Or they might head back and break into our room, hoping to get some coin that way.”

Arkk slowed down, frowning. Ilya was in the room. Ever since her little escapade to the Duke’s manor, she had not been all that lively. Even the promise that they would come back, properly prepared and ready to infiltrate one of the Duke’s parties hadn’t gotten her fully back to normal. It was her mother’s actions that bothered her.

To Arkk, it had sounded like a wise move on Alya’s part.  Unless Ilya had very much misrepresented the situation in her retelling, it sounded like Ilya had been about to assassinate the Duke. Arkk didn’t like the Duke any more than Ilya did, but that was the *worst* possible decision. They would never be able to simply kill the Duke in the middle of *his* city and get away.

Thanks to Alya, he didn’t have to deal with his friend’s momentary lapse in judgment.

He still had to deal with his employee’s trouble, however.

“We can’t let them go back to the Primrose. Ilya could probably get away normally, but with her moping about? I’d be worried.”

“We are going to take them, then?” Dakka asked with a grin. “Next backstreet past that building is a good spot.”

Arkk shot Dakka a glare. “Why do you know good spots for this kind of stuff?”

The dumb orc just grinned wider, but her grin stalled as she put on a serious expression. “They won’t fight like *we* did,” Dakka said in a hushed tone. “Rough them up a little and they’ll run with their tail between their legs. Literally, in the case of the lizardman. Frying them is going to be more trouble than it is worth.”

“I wasn’t planning on frying them,” Arkk said as they turned down the indicated alley. “And those elves just stopped following us. I think they heard.”

“Good. Two we don’t have to worry about.” Dakka paused, then shrugged as she leaned up against one building halfway down the alley. “Don’t remember pissing off any elves anyway.”

“But all the others following us have valid reasons, I’m sure,” Arkk said with a sigh.

Dakka didn’t get to respond before a quartet of orcs rounded the corner, followed closely by a lizardman. She barely glanced at them, not budging from her spot against the wall where she leaned with her arms crossed. “Depends on how valid you think losing some coin is.”

“How *much* coin?”

Glancing down, Dakka grabbed a large pouch that clanked as it moved. It filled her hand completely. Although she was small for an orc, she was still larger than Arkk, making it quite the hefty sack of money. “About three of these. Mostly silver. A few gold.”

“Hey!” the orc at the head of the group yelled.

“I could just pay them off,” Arkk said, eyes still on Dakka. “I’m rich, apparently.”

“They’ll just want more and more.”

“I’m—”

“We’re talking here!” Dakka shouted at the orc who was interrupting. Then she adopted a kind of smile Arkk had seen on orcs now and again. The kind that fully bared the lower tusks. “I know you,” she said, staring at the orc. She cracked her neck back and forth. Loud pops echoed between the worn planks of the wooden buildings. “You listened to my advice and brought friends. This’ll be fun.”

“*Fun*,” Arkk scoffed. “I was *hoping* to bump into Hawkwood with you, and now—”

Arkk leaped to the side, narrowly dodging a stone. His eyes snapped to the lizardman who threw it from a sling. If he hadn’t seen it through his… whatever his observational vision might be called, it would have hit him square in the chest. Probably with enough force to crack a rib.

The lizardman was in the middle of fetching another stone from a pouch at his hip, but his motions slowed under Arkk’s glare. The stone slipped from his fingers, clunking against the ground. An orc faltered, staring at Arkk with wide eyes. Given that the orc had been about to strike Dakka with a wooden club, it was far from the most opportune time to let his guard down. Dakka’s fist met his face, sending him sprawling to the ground.

Another orc, who had been ready to back up the first, jumped back well before Dakka hit the first. One orc, toward the back, turned and ran. The rest backed away slowly yet surely. One orc helped the fallen one up. Both turned and ran.

In a few seconds, the alley was empty.

Arkk looked around, making sure that Cliff’s guard force hadn’t marched up behind him, but there was no one there. Just him and Dakka.

“When you said we would have to rough them up, I thought you meant a *bit* more than that,” Arkk said with a frown. “You would think they would have put up more of a fight. Not that I’m complaining.”

“You mean, you didn’t do that on purpose?”

“Do… what?”

“That eye thing. Your eyes flashed red when that lizard threw the rock at you. Bright glowing red.”

“What? But…” Arkk trailed off, staring at himself from an outside perspective. As far as he could tell, he looked entirely normal.

“You’ve done it a few times,” Dakka said. “In the barrows once or twice, when Kazz’ak ambushed me. Those are just the times I saw it. I thought you were doing it on purpose. Glowing eyes are a pretty ominous omen. Figured you were trying to scare people.”

Arkk let out a small groan. “I think I need to talk to Vezta.”

“She has glowing eyes too.” Dakka shrugged. “Just saying…”

Shaking his head, Arkk looked down the backstreet. “They’re going to spread this around, aren’t they? Word of this is going to reach the inquisitors’ ears one way or another,” he said with a sigh. “I think we’ve overstayed our welcome in Cliff.”

“Sorry,” Dakka said, sounding genuine. “Probably should have held back a bit in the gambling.”

“It’s fine,” Arkk said with a sigh. “We’re just leaving a little earlier than planned. Go back to Primrose. Get Ilya and the cart. I’ll grab Zullie. We’ll meet outside the gate.”

They had already been planning on leaving in the morning, intending to return in the future after having come up with a way to get into one of the Duke’s parties. One day early wouldn’t matter. He already had what he needed from the city.

The sooner he put some distance between himself and the inquisitors, the better. For some reason, he doubted that Darius Vrox would turn and run if his eyes flashed red.

“You aren’t worried about me walking back on my own?” Dakka asked, insincere tone clear in her voice.

“You were about ready to fight all of them with me sitting it out, weren’t you?”

“The people in this city are soft, Arkk. Compared to what I’ve lived through? Five orcs and their lizard pet are fodder to be pushed aside.”

“Exactly,” Arkk said, shaking his head. “Meet me at the gates outside the city.”

“Sure thing, boss.” With a lazy wave, Dakka headed back the way they had come.

Arkk turned away, heading in the opposite direction. He started slowly at first, then picked up the pace with every step until he was in a swift jog. The sooner they left, the better. Those inquisitors *would* hear about some human with glowing eyes and he wanted to be nowhere nearby when they did.

Hurrying past the large statue at the Cliff Magical Academy’s entrance and into its labyrinth of corridors, Arkk quickly found himself at the door to Zullie’s office. After their meeting with Ilya and Dakka, he had come back the next day to help pack. And to take a look at the magical books she had. Most of her books and equipment were at the Primrose, ready to be loaded into the cart. Zullie, however, wanted even more. Having seen her office, Arkk well knew that it had far more books than even Fortress Al-Mir’s library before he remodeled it.

He was entirely unsurprised to find her trying to fit two too many books into an open crate.

“There is a limit to how much we can pack on the cart before the horse starts having trouble,” Arkk said. One crate probably wasn’t going to hurt, but he could see five empty crates up against the wall just waiting to be filled.

Zullie, rectangular glasses hanging off the end of her nose, squinted at Arkk over the rims. Setting one of the offending books down, she shoved the glasses up her face and frowned. “Are you a spellcaster or not?”

“Uh…”

Slapping the lid on the crate and securing it with a little metal latch, she turned it on its side, showing off the bottom. On one of the thick planks that made up the crate, Zullie had inscribed a complex ritual circle. She slapped her hand to it, held it there for a moment, then pulled back. Bright white lines of magic covered the circle for a moment before fading to a dull, barely-visible glow.

Grabbing hold of the crate, Zullie hefted it up and tossed it at him. Arkk grimaced, leaning a bit too far forward in anticipation of the weight. When it hit, he had to quickly step forward to keep from falling at the lack of its expected weight. Steadying himself, he held the crate in one hand.

“This feels like holding one book,” Arkk said, flipping the crate upside-down to get a better look at the ritual circle. “Not twenty.”

“A featherweight ritual. You haven’t used one before? Don’t know how people get things done without them.”

“I only know a few rituals,” Arkk admitted, hesitant. She had seen his lightning spell and was interested in that but didn’t exactly want to frighten her off by revealing himself to be the country louse that he was. “One that is either fire or light and I’m not sure which or if I’m doing it wrong, a tracking ritual—”

“That is a fairly complex ritual to know while not knowing featherweight.”

“Yeah,” Arkk said with a shrug. “I’m kind of self-taught. Picked up a few other rituals from travelers to my village. Though I do know a teleportation ritual, I’m not sure exactly how to set a destination. Something I should talk about with Vezta,” Arkk mumbled to himself.

“A… what?”

“Is that not a commonly known ritual?”

“Teleportation?” Zullie narrowed her eyes. “I don’t even know what that word is supposed to mean.”

“Well, I’m not exactly sure either.”

“How are you not—”

“Zullie!”

The door flung open behind Arkk. Priest Heller, panting slightly, looked around the room with worry on his thin face. That worry abruptly vanished when he spotted Zullie standing upright at her desk. He looked at her, confused, before shaking his head. “Thought you fainted again.”

“And just why would you think that?”

“Last time an inquisitor pulled up to the academy, you were in trouble,” he said with a shrug. “Worried you needed help, but now that I see you don’t, I’m going to leave. If they are here for you, I don’t want to be anywhere nearby.” With a curt nod of his head, Heller vanished as quickly as he appeared, leaving the door to gently swing shut behind him.

“Inquisitors,” Zullie said, nose wrinkling. “Again?”

Arkk, tense, moved to the door and peered out down the corridor. The priest was hurrying down the hall away from the entrance and a few others were walking about. No sign of the inquisitors yet.

They couldn’t possibly know about his eyes already, could they?

“We need to leave.”

“Leave?” Zullie rolled her eyes. “They do this once a year or so. Harass me and my good work. I was asleep when he came by, so he’s come back for that. Darius will come and frown at me for a few minutes—”

“They aren’t here for *you*,” Arkk said. “They’re here for me. Is there another way out of this place? Other than the front entrance.”

“After *you*?”

“I can explain later.” Arkk paused, then glanced back to Zullie. “If you still want to go with me knowing the inquisitors are after me, that is.”

“We haven’t done anything since their last visit,” Zullie said, crossing her arms.

“For some reason, I can’t shake the feeling that Vrox won’t be too friendly if he catches me. I don’t want to start a fight here. I don’t know what kind of sorcery he knows, but even if I do beat him, I won’t be able to beat all the city’s guards.”

“You’re serious.”

Arkk didn’t even finish nodding his head before she grabbed his arm and dragged him out into the hall. She took off in haste, heading away from the entrance. Without a word, she led him down one corridor, another, then crossed around another long corridor.

“You owe me,” Zullie said as they entered into a much darker and less well-traveled section of the academy. “All my poor books that I hadn’t packed…”

“*That* is what you’re worried about?”

“The most valuable ones are with your cart. They’re still safe, right?”

Quickly checking on Ilya and Dakka, he found both just barely leaving the stables next to the Primrose. As far as he could tell, there were still six crates of books in the back. “Yeah.”

“Then it isn’t a great loss. The academy will take care of them. But…” Zullie sighed.

She didn’t stop walking.

The corridors were becoming dustier and dustier. The glowstones on the walls weren’t doing much glowing. He didn’t know the theory of why but presumed they needed some kind of magical upkeep to maintain their luminosity. “Where are we going?” Arkk asked, eying the tiles on the floor.

He had thought of it before, but this place was similar to Fortress Al-Mir. The tiles weren’t *his* compass rose tiles, but they were close enough that he wouldn’t have been surprised to find the two places had been built by the same people.

“The academy is built into some old ruins. Dwarven, I think.”

“I thought dwarfs were extinct.”

“Very old ruins,” Zullie corrected herself. “This whole mountain is filled with crossing passages and unused rooms. Only the front section is commonly used. Technically, these passages are off-limits. Rumor has it that foolish initiates wandered into the deeper tunnels and never wandered back out. I’ve never seen a skeleton back here; maybe I haven’t explored far enough.”

“Is there a way out?” Arkk asked. He didn’t like the idea of becoming one of those rumored skeletons.

“There are, but…” Zullie slowed, glancing back behind them. “Listen,” she said, holding up a hand.

Arkk didn’t hear anything, but her eyes widened.

Zullie glanced down at the floor under their feet. It was dim in the faded glowstone light, but the footprints in the dust were clear to see. Stepping away from Arkk, pushing him against the wall in the process, she held her hands out around her and began to spin in place, around and around. “*Angin bertiup di sekitar saya dalam badai besar untuk menyapu musuh saya dari kaki mereka.*”

If Arkk hadn’t been up against a wall, he would have been thrown off his feet from the sudden gale that ripped through the corridor. As it was, the crate of books ripped out from his grip and went skidding across the floor until it caught on the edge of a doorway and broke open, sending books everywhere down the hall.

Opening his jaw popped his ears, but he didn’t get a chance to ask about that spell before Zullie grabbed his hand and rushed down the hall, away from the broken crate. She took two turns—the floor on the way had been cleared of dust from her spell—and ducked into a room. She didn’t stop until she had pressed him back into the corner.

“What—”

“Do not move. You will break the spell,” she said, then motioned with her hands in front of them, holding them up with her palms facing toward the doorway. “*Penyembunyian dari saksi mengambil bentuk apa yang paling diharapkan berdasarkan konteks daerah sekitarnya*.”

Arkk braced himself, not wanting to get blown away. However, this wasn’t that wind spell. At first, he wasn’t sure what it was doing, but then he looked at Zullie in front of him and blinked in confusion. She was there… Yet, she was also just another stack of boxes in this old storage room they had found themselves in.

Arkk didn’t dare ask, not wanting to break her concentration. Soon enough, he didn’t want to ask for fear of alerting whoever was in the corridor. He could hear someone moving out there. Their boots thumped against the tile floors, slowly growing louder in a slow, steady rhythm. Every so often, the footsteps momentarily faded and were replaced with the sound of doors creaking open out in the hall.

The footsteps drew closer.

The woman he had seen with Vrox in Langleey stepped inside the storage room. In the dim light, the faint glow in her many scars was all the more apparent. The very center of her pupils lit up with the same yellow as her scars as her head slowly scanned the room, looking from one side to the other. When her gaze reached the corner they were hiding in, Zullie’s arms started trembling.

Arkk shuddered. No wonder the orcs had run off, assuming his eyes looked anything like *that*.

Agnete, if Arkk remembered her name right, didn’t do anything aside from turning and leaving. Her footsteps faded as she continued down the hall, occasionally stopping as she opened doors.

Zullie’s arms dropped to her sides, ending the spell, almost the moment that Agnete left. However, neither she nor Arkk moved while they could still hear those steps. A few minutes after that, Zullie looked back.

“Holy Light,” she said, voice a shaking whisper. “That wasn’t just an inquisitor. That was a *purifier*.”

“I have no idea what that means. She called herself Purifier Agnete. Or Vrox did, anyway.”

Zullie shook her head. “You’re the real deal, aren’t you? Forbidden magics and everything.”

“Uh…”

Zullie gripped his wrist and pulled him to the door. She glanced both ways, then started walking back the same way they had just come. “Good Light, I am even more excited.”

“Excited? You aren’t worried about the scary woman with glowing eyes?”

“Terrified. It is said that purifiers wield holy flame, capable of burning anything. Wood, rock, water, air. It doesn’t matter. They can even burn down the sky.”

“That sounds like an exaggeration. But in case it isn’t, let’s get as far away as we can.”

“Agreed. There should be a way out not far from here.”

That was the best news Arkk had heard in a long while. The sooner he was out of Cliff, the better.

He just had to hope the inquisitors wouldn’t follow him all the way back to Langleey.

## 22 - Fortress Maintenance


“That was certainly a strange sensation,” Zullie said as she appeared within the halls of Fortress Al-Mir.

After Arkk explained the ‘hiring’ process to her over the week it took to return, she readily agreed. More in the interest of experiencing new magic than working for him, but as long as she was teaching him, Arkk wasn’t going to complain.

As soon as the cart had come within range of Fortress Al-Mir, Arkk had been able to move all the equipment, the cart and horse, and finally all four people. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what he was going to do with a horse underground, but he wanted off the roads as soon as possible. There had been no sign of the inquisitors following them. Arkk didn’t want to take the chance. If they were following, hopefully vanishing would throw them off.

Of course, they would just go to Langleey Village if they couldn’t find him, but he didn’t intend to go there anytime soon either.

Arkk sent Ilya and Dakka to their respective quarters, where they could clean up from the hasty journey they had just been on. As soon as he finished, he found Vezta, somewhere in the lower levels of the fortress, and pulled her in front of him and Zullie.

“Master,” Vezta said, bowing immediately without any sign of discomfort at her sudden relocation. “Welcome back. Several matters require your attention.”

“Emergencies?”

“No. The [HEART] chamber is overflowing with gold. Constructing a dedicated treasury will be required before we resume mining. In the interim, I have assigned your servants to expanding your territory toward both Langleey Village and the nearby burg.”

“Expansions?” Arkk said, quickly checking through the dungeon with his second sight.

“At the moment, they are little more than deep and narrow tunnels, easily defensible with the liberal application of traps. I presumed you would still wish to visit the village after the destruction of the teleportation circles and took the initiative. If that is not your desire, I apologize. We can collapse them easily.”

“No, that’s good,” Arkk said, pulling back. What he saw was exactly as Vezta described. “Don’t connect the passages with the surface yet. We might have trouble coming.”

“Trouble, Master?”

“Those inquisitors. They’re…” Arkk shook his head. “I’ll explain later. I want input from Olatt’an and Rekk’ar. First, this is Zullie.” Pausing to motion to his side, he found Zullie standing utterly still, wide-eyed with her mouth agape. “Zullie?”

Vezta’s eyes, both the glowing suns on her face as well as the smaller eyes dotted around her shoulders, wrists, and elsewhere shifted, focusing entirely on the woman she had been ignoring since appearing. After a moment, she cocked her head to the side. “Your latest minion appears to be faulty, Master.”

Arkk waved his hand in front of Zullie’s face, breaking the stupor. She blinked several times in a rapid fluttering before slowly turning her head toward Arkk. Although her head turned, her eyes were still locked on Vezta.

“This… isn’t a demihuman,” she whispered.

“I am the [SERVANT].”

“Zullie is a magical researcher from Cliff,” Arkk said. “I’ll be constructing quarters similar to my own and Ilya’s, but closer to the orc section of the fortress. I want you to teach her the lightning bolt spell after she gets settled.”

“Might I suggest placing her quarters near the library? That is the traditional location for magical research.”

Arkk paused, then nodded. “That’s doable.” Glancing to his side, he frowned at the woman who was once again staring. “Zullie,” he said, making her jump. “This is Vezta. She keeps the place tidy and running. And yes, she isn’t a demihuman. She’s pre-Calamity.”

“I… I…” Zullie’s jaw clamped shut. “If I were a magixenologist…”

“Try to get over the shock quickly,” Arkk said with a sigh. Ilya hadn’t acted like this. Neither had the orcs. Shaking his head, he glanced over to Vezta. “Gather everyone important for a meeting in… two hours. That includes Zullie and Dakka.”

“Understood. Shall I offer the malfunctioning human a tour while you construct sleeping quarters?”

Arkk nodded. “Best make sure the orcs know she is one of ours while you’re at it. I don’t want any accidents. Speaking of, has there been any trouble with them while I was gone?”

“There were some disgruntled murmurs that evolved into a small fight between a few of the orcs. Rekk’ar beat down the two most responsible, but several were involved. The two most injured are both recovering in the medical lair.”

“Permanent injuries?”

“Nothing particularly alarming. I tended to the worst wounds. I am no expert on orc physiology, but I would guess they will be back on their feet in another day or two.”

“I’ll speak with Rekk’ar then.”

Arkk didn’t bother to walk away. He instantly appeared in an empty room just down the hall from the library. A small pile of gold followed him. It was a rather small room and took a mere second to convert into the magical room that allowed inhabitants to construct their own private domiciles. The lair. If he hired more magical researchers in the future, he might have to figure out alternative living quarters, but for now, this should suffice for Zullie.

Quickly peeking into the [HEART] chamber, Arkk confirmed what Vezta had said. It was nearly impossible to stand anywhere without stepping on a pile of gold coins. Just how much gold was under the fortress anyway? A month ago, he might have fainted at the sight of all this wealth. Even now, knowing it all belonged to him had Arkk unsteady on his feet.

He wasn’t quite sure what building a proper treasury meant. As far as Arkk could tell, there wouldn’t be a problem just dumping it all into one of the many spare rooms the fortress had. He would have to ask Vezta later.

Before that, however, Arkk relocated out into the long tunnel that stretched between the fortress and Langleey Village. When Vezta had ordered the construction of the tunnel, she had done so with security in mind. Even though the [HEART] chamber was between the village and the orc section of the fortress, the tunnel stretched well past both before looping around. Any invading force that made it through the tunnel would have to face the orcs almost immediately after.

If Arkk had anything to say about it, an invading force wouldn’t make it through at all. Hearing about the abilities purifiers were said to possess did have him a little worried, but there wasn’t much he could do about that at the moment.

Whatever magic powered Fortress Al-Mir and the rooms it contained was a bit finicky in Arkk’s eyes. With a small pile of gold at his disposal, he could fashion a foundry that would make a king jealous. The fortress smithy could make expertly crafted tools, weapons, and even smaller things like doors and hinges. If he had a proper tailor, they could make the finest clothes in the land with all the expensive cloth and precision equipment that the fortress could provide.

However, the fortress seemed incapable of making an end product. He could expend gold to fill the tailor’s spools with bolts of the finest cloth, but he couldn’t make a cloak. Ingots of fine metal filled the smithy storage, but he couldn’t magically make a sword. He could make a room that would transform itself based on its occupants' comfort needs, but he couldn’t make a room that came with a bed and desk if he so desired. At least not without heading to the drawing board to sketch that out. Even then, the desk and bed would be of far lower quality.

Vezta had said it back before he made the contract. The fortress wanted artisans for some reason. It needed intelligent beings to run the place.

Traps, as it turned out, counted as an end product. Something he couldn’t conjure up with a liberal application of gold. Yet, in a strange way, they were similar to rooms. He designated a location and determined the type of trap that he wanted, whereupon he would receive proper schematics to hand off to the blacksmith or whoever was required to build the thing.

Unfortunately, Arkk didn’t know much about trap building. Vezta didn’t have ready-made plans for traps. Not to mention, they seemed like it would be best to design bespoke traps for the location he was trying to defend.

Here, a long and narrow tunnel, Arkk had only two good ideas.

Dragging a lesser servant from elsewhere in the fortress, Arkk pointed along the tunnel. “Dig periodic pitfalls,” he said. It had worked on the orc chieftain. Large crevasses alone would work well to stymie intruders, but he was hoping to cover them with trapdoors that he could open at will.

Beyond pitfalls… there were probably a lot of things he could do. But having been to Cliff recently, Arkk took inspiration from the massive ballistae they had watching their front gate. Those things had been intended to throw log-sized arrows that would destroy catapults, trebuchets, or other large war machines. Presumably. He hadn’t asked anyone to confirm that suspicion.

In a narrow yet straight tunnel, a log-sized arrow would plow through an entire army if they tried to invade. Arkk doubted any army was going to come marching on the fortress but those inquisitors might. Although they hadn’t attacked him so far, after everything he had heard in Cliff from Zullie and Priest Heller, and what Vrox himself had said on their few encounters, Arkk doubted they would be all that happy to find Vezta or the fortress.

Maybe it was his contract with the [HEART], maybe it was the wealth, maybe it was a debt of gratitude toward Vezta, but he felt it was his responsibility to ensure that Fortress Al-Mir remained safe and secure.

Designating a location for a door at the far end of the tunnel—when doors were damaged, the fortress alerted Arkk, allowing him to get people ready to man the ballista or otherwise defend the place—Arkk felt he had at least a good start. He moved to the other tunnel, the one headed to Smilesville Burg, and repeated the same defenses over there. Once done, he moved to the smithy.

Detailed designs for the defensive parts needed were already up on the board. Or, at least, the metal parts were. Arkk presumed the wooden parts would have to come from elsewhere. He did not currently have a lumber processing room, so perhaps he would commission pieces from John. Or just invite the carpenter down into the fortress, not that Arkk thought he would want to live inside permanently.

They had sealed up all the fissures in the ceilings, but there was a certain temptation to open a few intentional areas for allowing a *little* sunlight to reach the living areas of the fortress and make it a little more palatable to live within. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t be much of a fortress if it were full of holes.

Satisfied that things would proceed for the time being, Arkk focused on Rekk’ar. The burly orc was in the middle of a meal, seated in the large feasting hall not far from the kitchens. Arkk didn’t appear directly in front of the orc; Vezta didn’t mind sudden appearances, but popping out of nowhere tended to disturb most everyone else unless they were expecting it. Instead, Arkk appeared outside the door, which promptly swung open to admit his passage.

A few others were eating as well, all of whom looked up as Arkk walked by. Two looked like they weren’t sure if they should stand. Arkk gave them a brief nod of his head as a greeting but didn’t stop until he reached the head of a long table. Rekk’ar, notably, did not get up. He barely looked up from his roast chicken dinner.

“You’re back.”

“Only just,” Arkk said, taking the seat next to the orc. “I heard there was trouble while I was gone. Two people are in the medical lair?”

“Nothing that couldn’t be handled,” Rekk’ar grunted, tearing off a strip of chicken with his teeth.

“They’re getting restless,” Olatt’an said, walking alongside the table. He took a seat across from Arkk, setting a plate of chicken down as he did so. “I’ve seen it before among prisoners and ship crew. They become agitated, distraught, and occasionally violent from prolonged confinement. It isn’t so bad right now—those two have been at each other’s throats since *I* was in charge—but you can just feel the unease in the air. It won’t be the last time a fight breaks out like that.”

Arkk wasn’t at all surprised to hear that the old orc had been imprisoned before. He simply nodded. “I learned a bit about how mercenaries work while I was gone. I’m not sure what might be offered locally, but in the city, there were a variety of jobs that I think we could do. Maybe even enjoy.” Arkk glanced between the two orcs. “How do you feel about gorgons?”

That got Rekk’ar to stop eating. The green-skinned orc stared, eyes narrowing. Olatt’an, on the other hand, just started shaking his head with a few low chuckles.

“Gorgon*s*?” Rekk’ar said after a long moment. “More than one?”

“The posting I saw didn’t say how many, exactly, but it said the mine was *overrun*. I presume that means at least a few.”

“I’m not here to throw my life away for you,” Rekk’ar snarled.

Arkk held up his hands, leaning back in the chair. “That was pretty much the advice I got when I was looking at the job. Just thought I’d ask.”

Rekk’ar bared his tusks before turning back to his food.

“In that case, there were several other things. I presume you don’t care what it is, within reason, as long as we get people some exercise and fresh air?”

“If gorgons are your upper limit, I would be fascinated to discover what ‘within reason’ means,” Olatt’an said, still chuckling.

“Don’t accept *any* job without running it by me first,” Rekk’ar said. With that, he dove back into his meal.

“Slightly too late for that,” Arkk said with a wince that he tried to keep off his face. At Rekk’ar’s glower, he quickly added, “Nothing on the level of gorgons, just a missing girl. I plan to have Vezta try to scry for her.”

The orc glowered but nodded his head. “Doesn’t sound like good exercise.”

“I’ll see about stopping by Smilesville Burg tomorrow.” The tunnel wasn’t finished yet, but the servants would continue their work overnight. If they dug a small shaft to the surface, he should be able to get out to the burg early on. “Sorry for disturbing your meal. I’d like to have a proper meeting in about an hour. Vezta will be by around then to collect you.”

Rekk’ar just grunted while Olatt’an waved him away as Arkk stood. Rekk’ar felt a little testy during that brief conversation, making Arkk wonder if he had actually been injured in the fight and was hiding it, if he was getting a little stir-crazy himself, or if he just didn’t like having his meal interrupted.

Whatever the case, Arkk walked away a few steps before teleporting once again.

“—shouldn’t be possible,” Zullie shouted, waving her arms around her new quarters.

Before, it had just been a carpeted chamber. A fairly small one at that. Zullie now stood in front of a thick bed, large enough for several people to share with comfort. A translucent sheer curtain hung from a single point on the wall, stretching to all four corners of the bed. Next to the bed, glowing crystals adorned a large desk. On top sat an alchemical station for concocting small potions and a small stack of books.

Zullie had a book in her hand, open to a page toward the end. She had her hand on the page, glaring at it.

Vezta simply stood to the side, faint smile looking a little more strained than usual.

“Is there a problem?” Arkk asked, stepping inside.

“You!” Zullie shouted, stomping over to him. She thrust the book out toward him, almost striking him in the face as she held it open for him to see. “What is the meaning of this?”

The page was filled with text in tight, neat scrawl. Handwritten, not made using a printing press. There was far too much to read at the moment, so Arkk gently pushed the book down to meet Zullie’s violet eyes. “Was your book damaged when we transported it?”

“It isn’t my book. I’ve never seen it before in my life. But it’s *my* spell,” she said. “I invented it. Why is it in a book that just appeared in the room? *How* did the room just appear? Why is it in my handwriting?”

Arkk had exactly zero answers for the woman. Looking over her shoulder, he met Vezta’s eyes.

The servant just shrugged. As she had said several times, she was just a servant. She knew a little magic, apparently from when her former master had possessed her then used that magic, and she knew about the [HEART]. The *details* of how it functioned were never made available to her.

“Magic,” Arkk said with a smile.

That was the wrong answer. He could see it in Zullie’s face.

Before she could start yelling again, he held up his hands. “I don’t know for sure, but I imagine whatever runs this place is pre-Calamity. Who knows how it really works? But that’s why I hired you, right? Unlock the mysteries of all this old magic… and maybe craft some spells with this old magic that are short enough to be worth using in active combat.”

“Pre-Calamity,” Zullie whispered to herself as she looked at the book with wide eyes, awed by whatever nonsense Arkk had just tried to placate her with.

He had no idea if it was even possible to figure out how anything here worked. But then, he wasn’t a spell researcher. Zullie was.

“Anyway, was just checking in. I’ll leave you to your tour,” Arkk said.

Before she could interrupt, he appeared outside a wooden door elsewhere in the fortress. Gently, Arkk tapped his knuckles against the door.

“Come in!”

Arkk stepped into the castle-like room that Ilya called her own. She sat at a large desk with several rolls of vellum set out before her. The outfit that the tailor servant had made was propped up on her bed, currently on the receiving end of intense scrutiny. As Arkk stepped closer to Ilya, she frowned as he looked over the papers. Each had a little sketch of clothing. Some dresses, some suits, others chemise with long gowns, surcoats, and more besides.

“What’s all this?” Arkk asked, motioning to the array of papers. “Getting into fashion?”

Ilya looked over them, then to the nice gown spread out on the bed. “It isn’t enough,” she said with a sigh. “You didn’t see them, but the clothing that the people at the Duke’s manor had would make this look like a peasant’s work clothes.”

“I thought it was a nice dress.”

“Compared to anything in Langleey, maybe. I just feel like we’ll be laughed out of any party we manage to get into. Assuming we can get into one in the first place.”

“We will,” Arkk said. “I have been stirring a bit of a plan for that.”

“Oh?”

“Not quite fully realized. It’ll take a bit to get running and has to do with the viscount we ran into. I’ll tell you about it with the others in an hour. We’re having a little meeting regarding what we learned in Cliff, so be ready.” Arkk looked over at the dress. “Though perhaps it would be a good thing if we could hire a proper tailor if you say it isn’t good enough.”

“It isn’t.”

“I wonder where we would find someone.”

Ilya frowned for a long moment, staring at the dress. She reached out and rubbed its long sleeve, then her eyebrows popped up. “I… might have an idea.”

“Oh?” Arkk said, returning her earlier question.

“Not quite realized… but why don’t you leave finding a tailor to me.”

“You know a tailor?” Arkk asked, not believing her for a moment. Having grown up with her, he knew what she knew and she did *not* know a tailor aside from Higgens in Langleey. They had already dismissed him as a possibility.

“I don’t know anyone specifically… Can I take a few orcs on a little road trip to the north? I remember my mother talking about her ancestral home. There have to be elves there both capable of making good clothes and willing to help her out.”

“You… want to go visit other elves?” Arkk said, suddenly feeling a tightening sensation in his chest. He tried to push it down, to ignore it.

Ilya noticed and promptly rolled her eyes. “Arkk. Please. This is for my mother, nothing else. Even if it was for something else,” she started, but stopped with a shake of her head. “I could try to go on my own, but I thought a few bodyguards would make the trip safer.”

“No. No. Don’t go alone,” Arkk said with a slow nod of his head. “If they agree to go, take the orcs with you.”

Ilya glared. “Are you paying them or not? Tell them to go, *boss*.”

“Point. I guess,” Arkk said with a sigh. “And it would get some of them out of here for a while.” It would be something to bring up with Olatt’an and Rekk’ar at the meeting. “When are you thinking you’re going to leave? And how soon?”

“We’ll set off in the morning. Then…” she shrugged. “A week after that to reach Marrowlands Fen, plus a few days there? And the same to return. Maybe more. I’ve never been there. I don’t know how long it will take to reach.”

“Give me something a little more defined at the meeting, but I’ll probably say yes.”

“Good. Then get out of here. I need to plan,” she said, then started pulling open drawers on her desk, mumbling to herself, “I need a map…”

Arkk smiled despite the unease in his chest, watching her work for a few moments before he turned. With how listless she had been after their arrival at Cliff, seeing her moving and working was a relief. Hopefully, she would keep it up.

Heading to the adjacent room, Arkk kicked off his boots and sat down on the bed, finally ready to rest for a while before the meeting started.

## 23 - Visit to Cliff Aftermath


Three days into her journey and Ilya was starting to question whether this was a good idea.

When younger, her mother had told her about her people. The elven community that had raised her mother was somewhere in the northwestern areas of the Duchy of Mystakeen. A locale known as Marrowlands Fen. Geographically, it was an interesting area. Lots of islands of varying sizes right on the edge of the ocean with people living on most if not all of them.

Unfortunately, Alya’s stories had not included directions. They had been less stories and more anecdotes of her time among them. One story in particular, the one that set Ilya off on this idea in the first place, had been about Alya’s younger sister. An elf by the name of Prya who, according to Alya, made the most beautiful clothing in all the elven village. That would have been about six hundred years ago. Hopefully, Prya had kept up with her tradecraft in the time since then.

Ilya wasn’t sure what she would find when she arrived but she was hoping that her mother’s family was around. Not just for Prya but for all of her mother’s family. She could probably find any elven commune and find a centuries-old elf with plenty of practice at tailoring elegant dresses but she doubted that she would find real *help*.

She had never thought she would be able to rescue her mother from the clutches of the Duke. Arkk, the fortress, their newfound wealth, and the strange assistance offered by a pre-Calamity monster made that impossibility sound ever so slightly achievable. Yet, of all the things she listed, she really only trusted Arkk. Family, even family she had never met, would hopefully both help recover her mother—even if only by making clothing—and help keep them from letting all this wealth and power go to their heads.

The problem was getting there.

“I see, thank you,” Ilya said.

“This is the last burg you’ll find for about a week of travel if you’re heading up in that direction.” The butcher helping her load salted meat into the back of her cart talked as he worked. “There are a few villages dotted here and there but you might not be able to resupply as much as you want. I would suggest you prepare but…” He laughed, slapping a crate on the lid. “You’ve practically cleaned me out of all my preserved meat.”

“I wonder if I should get more,” she hummed, more to herself than to him.

The butcher heard anyway. “More? This’ll last five a month.”

“I’m traveling with about a dozen. Orcs,” she added. “They eat a bit more than most.”

“A dozen orcs?” The old man glanced around, looking more suspicious now than he had before “You aren’t in trouble, are you?”

“No, no. Nothing like that. They’re bodyguards. We all work for Company Al-Mir.”

“Ah. Mercenary business? They aren’t helping you supply up?”

“Something like that,” Ilya said. “And they are. They’re just getting supplies elsewhere,” she lied. In an attempt to change the topic, she quickly asked a question before he could say anything else. “Any dangers on the road ahead?”

“Always dangers. The western side of the duchy has slavers and bandits running amok. They practically run the whole area.” He let out a small laugh, looking around once again. “If you’re traveling with a dozen battle-hardened orcs, I doubt you’ll get any trouble though. They like easy targets.”

“They run the area? What about the Duke’s men?”

“Too busy manning the border. Word passing through here is that the damn Sultanate is getting a bit uppity these days,” he said with a sad shake of his head. “Lots of soldier-types making their way over there as of late. Times are getting interesting but… I think I prefer boring times.”

“I get that,” Ilya said as she secured the crates in the back of the cart. “Thanks for your help. I’d best get moving.”

“Sure thing. Take care of yourself,” the butcher said, nodding his head. Dusting off his hands on his bloodstained apron, he turned and headed back into his shop.

Ilya quickly moved the cart. She went along to several other shops and purchased supplies. All on her own. Like the butcher, most questioned what she was doing, loading up so much traveling gear all for herself. She offered them the same excuse she gave the butcher. The others were just collecting their own supplies. Maybe the merchants would all have a get-together and talk about the strange woman buying up all the gear in town. They would realize that she had lied but by then, she would be long gone.

By the time she was finished, the light in the sky was dimming. She would have liked to have found a stayover to rest for the night. Unfortunately, she didn’t have that luxury at the moment. Ignoring the warnings of the burg’s guard, she ventured out onto the road and started traveling. She didn’t intend to make a full leg of the journey tonight, of course. Rather, she traveled along the road just until she spotted the dancing light of a fire burning off the beaten path.

Directing the horses off to the side of the road, she quickly came up to a camp of rowdy orcs, laughing and talking around a large bonfire. It was obvious that they were excited to be out of the fortress. Ilya was as well, if she were being honest. Sometimes it was easy to forget where that fortress was but the lack of sunlight and that constant feeling of wrongness that came from being in the Cursed Forest weighed heavily.

As soon as the lookout noticed her and called out to the others, a ripple spread through the group. Laughter cut off, voices died down, and soon enough, Ilya found herself standing in front of a dozen silent orcs. All of whom were staring.

“Took you long enough.”

*Almost* all were staring.

Olatt’an sat at the side of the bonfire, leaning against a toppled log in a lax pose, barely even glancing up to meet her eyes.

Ilya wasn’t sure if it was disrespect, his usual mellow demeanor, or if he knew that the way the other orcs acted at her arrival disturbed her but whatever the case, she vastly preferred his presence to that of the others. Still, his words incensed her.

“*I* took long enough? I had to walk around, carrying heavy crates and kegs all by myself from morning until sunset. And what did you lot do all day? Sat around on your fat asses? Why are you wanted in *every* burg in the Duchy? Dakka didn’t have this problem.”

“Dakka was new.”

“Young.”

“A runt,” someone said.

“Don’t call her that,” Ilya snapped. She let out a long, withering sigh. “This is going to be a long journey. You don’t need to make it longer by complaining about *me* when you lot are—”

“Did you say kegs?” Kazz’ak called out.

Ilya shot him a glare that faded before it could really begin. Reaching back over the cart, she threw off the tarp that kept their supplies out of the elements. Three large barrels sat horizontally in the back of the cart. “These two are water,” she said, standing and tapping a foot against two of them. “The third… is ale.”

A brief pause of silence shattered to pieces as a cheer ran through the crowd of orcs. They surged forward as one only to stop short as Ilya stomped a foot down on the cart’s edge.

“But!” she shouted. “This is going to be a long journey. Longer than we thought. The next burg is a week away and there is no guarantee they’ll have excess ale there. Marrowlands Fen is further than I thought, so we’ve got a long march ahead of us. If this is all gone tonight, well, I’m not going back to that burg for more.”

With that said, she jumped off the cart and stalked through the crowd until she reached the only orc that wasn’t gathering around the ale keg. She sank down against the log and crossed her arms.

“They’re going to be useless in the morning,” Olatt’an said.

“They better not be useless in the morning,” Ilya said, loud enough that at least a few of the orcs in the back heard.

“You didn’t have to get that.”

“Yeah… well,” Ilya started, voice softer. “I’m not here to be your friend. You lot are being paid to be out here. But if dropping a few silver on a bunch of alcohol gets them to stop tip-toeing around me, I’ll take it. That’s just going to make this trip drag on at a snail’s pace.”

“I understand the reasoning but drunk orcs will make it drag on as well,” Olatt’an said with a small chuckle. “Longer than we thought, huh?”

“A bit over two weeks to reach Marrowlands Fen from here. No idea about where the elves are located within the fen. Hopefully one of the burgs closer will have more information.”

“Hopefully,” Olatt’an repeated. Clapping his hands on his thighs, he stood. “Best get me a mug before they drain the entire keg.”

“You’re having some as well?” Ilya said, not bothering to hide the note of disappointment in her tone.

“If it is any good, it will be wasted on these runts. If it's bad ale, well, I’m just sparing them from having to drink more.” Olatt’an flashed his tuskless grin. “I *am* an orc,” he said, turning away.

Ilya crossed her arms and glared at the tan orc’s back. “A long journey indeed,” she mumbled to herself.

She was wondering if this was a good idea at all.

***

The sea started to boil.

The Grand Old Church of Cliff City sat atop a small island jutting up from the water in the middle of the bay. The winding staircase that led up to the cathedral on top had a little-used path that ran downward. The stairs ended at a small boat dock, one that had hardly seen any use since the bridge had been built.

Agnete didn’t often come to the city of Cliff. When she did, it was usually for only a short amount of time. The life of an inquisitor rarely had them remaining in the larger settlements of the land. While cultists and other subversive elements did occasionally try to infest the city, local priests and bishops were usually enough to root them out. Inquisitors were sent out into the less well-traveled areas of the Kingdom where a deviant might be able to otherwise make their lair without anyone the wiser until after their plans came to fruition.

Moving from town to town. Incinerating a totem to a foul god. A witch burned there. There was always more to be done. Never staying for long. Perhaps someone ended up saved here or there. Agnete never got to meet them. It was always on to the next place, to stymie the seemingly endless tide of enemies of the Light.

It was a… cold existence.

There weren’t often moments to take for herself. Agnete had learned to cherish them when they came.

On a previous visit to Cliff, she had discovered this spot. Down the stairs of the Grand Old Church, past the unused dock, and around the rocky wall of the island was a small sandbar. The perfect spot to toss off her boots, her cloak, and the rest of her clothes and wade out into the waters.

The waters boiled against her bare skin.

Bending, Agnete scooped up a fistful of sand. The individual grains began to glow a white-hot as they began merging together into one smooth flow of molten glass. Ankles in the water, Agnete sat against a large stone and began to massage the liquid-like glass. She flicked her thumbnail through the glass, creating neat lines in the blob. Scooping up more sand, she added it to the mass, pulling out a sharp point from one end while rounding the other.

Agnete worked in silence. The only sounds were the waves slapping against the island and the sizzling noise of water turning to steam against her legs.

A chill wind swept over her. Normal cold didn’t bother Agnete in the slightest. This made her lock up. She stiffened, dropping the glass sculpture into the water as she bolted to her feet.

“Purifier.”

Agnete slowly turned, facing the dock just to the side of her little sandbar.

Darius Vrox stood on the worn wooden planks, leaning against one of the piles anchoring the dock to the ground. One hand was in his long coat’s pocket while the other drummed against the wood. Those fingers stopped abruptly as, behind his large round glasses, Darius narrowed his eyes.

“What are you doing?”

“Awaiting our next move, Sir.”

Darius looked over her before his eyes roamed over to the clothes she had left draped over the rope railing of the dock. “You get precious little time off. Can you not enjoy it like a normal person?”

Agnete opened her mouth but Darius held up a hand.

“I don’t care. Douglas and I have been going over the texts sent over by Central, trying to uncover exactly what we are dealing with. We’ve been stumped, mostly, but there is one thing I would like clarification on. You referred to the young man as *empty*. Elaborate.”

Pressing her lips together, Agnete thought back to her first meeting with Arkk back in the small town of Langleey. She was different than other people. Special in some ways, broken in others. Like other purifiers, she could wield fire magic without incantations or ritual circles. She could sense heat and fire even at a distance. And, within people, she could see embers. The soul. Or so she assumed. There had been no confirmation made by any of the Abbey of the Light’s researchers.

It was just what she felt.

“You and I have a flame inside us. He didn’t. I don’t know what that means.”

“Please don’t compare us,” Darius said with his half-smile. “It sickens me.”

Agnete clamped her jaw shut.

“Perhaps he is less human than we thought. Or what made him human has been removed.” Darius removed his hand from his pocket, shaking off a few flecks of frost before he started rubbing at his chin. “Could the creature be controlling him?”

Unsure as to whether or not Darius was asking her or merely wondering aloud to himself, Agnete played it safe and remained silent. Which, after a momentary pause, seemed to be the correct decision. Darius paid her little attention as he continued speaking.

“No. He seemed active and independent during our encounters. He has a proper history with the people of his village. They would likely have noticed something. Unless they had all been affected similarly?”

Feeling like that question was directed more toward her than the ambient aether, Agnete said, “Langleey’s baron felt normal to me. He had the same burning core inside him that… most people have.”

“Have you ever encountered someone with the same affliction as Mister Arkk?”

Agnete shook her head slowly. “No, Sir.”

“I see. Very well. Carry on with…” Darius looked around. “Whatever it is you were doing. Douglas and I will fetch you when we are ready to move again.”

“Understood.”

Darius turned and began his long climb up the steps toward the Grand Old Church. Agnete remained still, watching his back until he rounded the island’s mountain and vanished from view. Only then did she let out a warm sigh as she looked down at the water around her feet. The boiling stopped.

Reaching a hand into the water, Agnete felt around until her fingers found a smooth shape among the sandy grit. Standing upright, she withdrew a small glassy raven. A bit of seaweed had gotten tangled around its neck. She spent a moment trying to untangle it but only seemed to make the problem worse. Frustrated, she sent a surge of heat through her arm.

The seaweed noose burned away. The raven, unfortunately, did not come away unscathed from her burst of heat. It drooped, sagging into a shapeless blob.

Lips pressed together, Agnete turned up the heat to the point where small globs of glass ran between her fingers, falling to the sea below where they sizzled and cracked before rejoining the sand at the bottom.

That was why she was not allowed to help research in the archives. They didn’t want ancient and unique books going up in flames.

Cracking her neck, Agnete found her seat once again. She reached into the steaming water and pulled up a fresh fistful of sand.

## 24 - Magical Experiments


Arkk placed a long list in front of Rekk’ar, then stepped back and waited for the orc to look over the notes.

The first mercenary expedition had been a resounding success. It had been a simple task. A baron of a nearby village had been having trouble with wolves attacking his livestock. The dozen orcs Arkk had taken with him had been more than happy to hunt them down, culling the numbers. They even behaved themselves for the duration of a small feast in the village. The residents had been a bit surprised at Arkk’s choice of company, but no one had been able to argue with the pelts brought back.

It wasn’t enough. Not if Arkk planned to succeed. A few wolves taken care of for a village that few would have heard of out in the greater Duchy wouldn’t be nearly enough.

“No gorgons,” Rekk’ar said, striking the item from the list with an angry swipe of his pen.

“I merely included it for completeness’ sake.”

Rekk’ar just grumbled, striking several other items from the list. With a final glance over the list, he shoved it back over to Arkk.

Arkk immediately adopted a frown. “You crossed off all the large jobs.”

“We’re orcs, not your *servant* or you,” Rekk’ar said, standing. “I’m aware of our limits and, being responsible for the rest, cannot condone a suicide mission.”

Arkk pointed at one of the crossed-out items. “Surely a single vampire—”

“I don’t know much about vampires, it is true. I know you don’t either, so don’t bother denying it.” Rekk’ar grinned when Arkk couldn’t say anything. “They wouldn’t be offering that much if it was a simple task. Maybe we can do it easily. Maybe not. Do research and get back to me.”

Arkk gave him a look at being commanded around, but Rekk’ar just laughed. “Why did you cross off the viscount’s daughter? I kind of already accepted it…”

Even if he hadn’t accepted it, it was the one job Arkk was most interested in. The one that might put their name out there faster than any other single job. Viscounts, though Arkk wasn’t sure what exactly they did with their time even after meeting one, were important people.

Rekk’ar shrugged. “If nobody else has done it by now, the girl is either dead, doesn’t want to go back, or is being held by something too big for people like us to deal with. No matter what, a bunch of orcs getting involved with a missing human girl is only going to end poorly for us.”

“That…” Arkk sighed. “I can see your reasoning, but I’m overruling it. Getting a viscount vouching for us is the best way to get our name out there.”

“Waste of time,” Rekk’ar said, shaking his head but without fighting it further. “Might I suggest the expedition to a lost pyramid? It would get the boys some fresh air and get them moving. Maybe get us some treasure too.”

Arkk nodded slowly but didn’t think that job would be worth it at all. Not unless that lost pyramid brought with it great fame as well as fortune. With the state of Fortress Al-Mir’s gold mine, he didn’t need any treasure. Not that he said that. To the best of his knowledge, only he and Vezta knew of the wealth sitting around the [HEART]. Technically Zullie had heard as well, but the researcher had thrown herself into trying to uncover the magical mysteries of the fortress. She probably hadn’t even heard Vezta.

“Not worried about gorgons or vampires inhabiting a lost pyramid?”

“Figured they would have made a bit more noise.”

“I don’t know. I found Vezta here. The fortress was completely abandoned at the time and I had lived next door to it my entire life. Never suspected a thing.”

“Then you should be even more interested in it,” Rekk’ar said. “Maybe you’ll find another servant.”

Arkk opened his mouth to discredit that assumption, only to find that he couldn’t. After all, why couldn’t there be another creature like Vezta at some lost pyramid in the middle of nowhere? Looking down at the notes he had taken regarding that particular job, Arkk started nodding to himself.

“The expedition is being led by an elf along with some historian. They want a few guards for the journey. Get me three to five people who won’t have problems taking orders from an elf.”

Rekk’ar nodded, then headed to the door. As he moved, he said, “I’ll have your team by tonight.”

“Good. They can requisition whatever they need from the blacksmith, food supply, and whatever else.”

With a final nod, Rekk’ar stepped outside the meeting room.

Arkk didn’t linger. He teleported away, reappearing inside the fortress library. With the addition of Zullie’s crates of books, it was looking like a library these days. Zullie stood over three open books on the desk. She kept looking back and forth between the two of them while scribbling into the third.

His appearance had gone unnoticed thus far. Even after clearing his throat, she didn’t look up from whatever she was working on.

“Zullie.”

“Busy!”

Sighing, Arkk stepped closer, looking over her shoulder. As far as Arkk could tell in his inexpert observations, she was attempting to dissect the lightning spell. Most of what she was writing made no sense to him. Lots of words, lots of numbers. Since arriving back here, she had given him one of the beginner books she had brought and told him to get through it and then ask questions if he had any. He was only about a third of the way into it. There was just so much going on.

Between running the fortress and mercenary work, there just hadn’t been much time to sit back and read. And he was busy keeping a lookout for any sign that the inquisitors had followed him back to Langleey. Both tunnels were complete now and both had hidden entrances just outside the village and burg. He could teleport in, ask around, and get out in the blink of an eye. The extended tunnels came with the added benefit that they increased the size of his territory, allowing transport from outside the fortress into it from much further out.

“Did Vezta get around to teaching you the spell?”

Zullie didn’t answer right away, finishing her current batch of notes first. Eventually, she turned her head. “Nope!”

“I told her—”

“There wasn’t any need. I cast it myself on my own just using the incantation you gave me.”

“Oh? You figured it out on your own?”

“Not quite,” Zullie said with a frown. “More accurately, there was nothing to figure out. Simply repeating the incantation you gave me allowed me to cast three lightning bolts in a row before I felt like I was about to pass out. Through a few repeated tests, I believe I have discovered a few things. First of all, only I can cast that spell.”

“I’ve been fairly successful at it as well.”

Zullie held up a finger. “Sorry. I meant outside this place, I sincerely doubt anyone would be capable of casting that spell. When you performed whatever ritual magic made me an ‘employee’ and let you move me around, it created a connection between us. I’m having a very difficult time analyzing that connection, but it is that connection that allows me to cast the spell. It simply requires far too much magic to cast for any individual spellcaster. A team might be able to pool their magic together, but not any individual without your connection.”

“So you’re leeching magic from me?”

“Not you, there is something else here,” she said, looking around with narrowed eyes. Her gaze eventually landed back on Arkk. “I suspect you know what it is, however.”

The [HEART]. Arkk didn’t say anything and he tried not to react—the [HEART] was something only known to him, Ilya, and Vezta and he intended to keep it that way.

Still, Zullie nodded as if she expected his reaction or lack thereof.

“Wait,” Arkk said, “if the magic isn’t coming from you, does that mean I would be able to teach the lightning spell to all the orcs? Any employee, for that matter, regardless of whether or not they were capable of magic beforehand?”

“I doubt they will manage well,” Zullie said, scribbling a little note down on the side of her already full page. “Maybe a single weak bolt? I could be considered in the upper echelon of spellcasters in terms of power. If I can barely manage, I doubt a bunch of uneducated orcs will get much of a spark. Still, a fascinating experiment, to be sure.”

Perhaps only as an experiment, however. Half the orcs only agreed to work for him because he could sling magic around. If they could do it too… well, they would still have to break their employee bond and then… then they wouldn’t be able to cast at all. So perhaps it was a good idea all around then? It would make the orcs vastly more effective if they could use magic as well as their already superior martial prowess.

Maybe Rekk’ar would agree to some more prestigious jobs.

“Another thing I discovered was that the lightning spell you use is an entirely separate *system* of magic from what I—or anyone else—knows. It is the difference between magic and the holy spells wielded by higher-ranking members of the Abbey of the Light. I didn’t realize it right away because two words are hardly enough to linguistically compare to regular spells but by breaking it down analytically, it becomes obvious. I’m not sure what this means, exactly. I need more samples to work with.”

“I only know two other spells. I haven’t even used one and the other… *Slave Natum*.”

A lesser servant formed between them, slopping to the ground as a gaggle of eyes formed on its pulsating mass. Zullie stumbled back, bumping into a shelf hard enough to knock a few books down around her.

Arkk whisked the creature away, sending it to join the others in digging out a room on a lower level of the fortress. The new treasury.

“I think I’m going to be sick,” Zullie said, pressing one hand hard against the base of her throat.

“Should have warned you. Sorry. You get used to them.”

After a few breathing exercises, during which Zullie managed to keep herself from throwing up, she shook her head. “I think I’ll pass on that one. What was that?”

“A servant of the fortress. They dig out new rooms, claim land, reinforce walls, keep things clean, repair damaged areas, and do other general maintenance work.”

“There are more of them?”

“Eight, right now. I try to keep them out of view for obvious reasons. Vezta was going to show me how to make them a little more aesthetically pleasing, but we’ve been busy with other things.”

Zullie shook her head again and, after a few more deep breaths, looked up to Arkk. “The other spell?”

“I don’t think it is one you can use. When I learned it, it was kind of just shoved into my head, but from what I understand, it is something only I can use. It, uh, lets me possess an employee.”

“Possess?”

Arkk shrugged. “I haven’t used it. Don’t know the exact details. Just the general concept.”

“Well? Test it out already.”

“Right now?”

Zullie spread her arms wide as if to say *go ahead*.

Arkk, however, wasn’t an idiot. An untested spell that could take control of someone else’s body sounded like the perfect way to mess something up. So, he ripped Vezta through space, pulling her from her work in the room with the large crystal archway. He felt a bit bad about dragging her away, especially because he was rather interested in her work with reopening the portal, but she didn’t mind.

As usual, Vezta simply bowed without any apparent discomfort or surprise.

“I’m going to test the possession spell.”

“Excellent,” Vezta said with a smile. “It is a good one to get used to. Keeps you safe while allowing you full use of your abilities. Will you be testing it on myself or your employee?”

Arkk glanced between the two. Vezta was the obvious choice. She had already stated that it was considered an honor to be possessed in this fashion. However, her body was about as far from human as it could possibly get. Arkk had no idea how the spell worked beyond that it took over someone’s bodily autonomy. Would he even be able to function while possessing Vezta?

Zullie, on the other hand, stood with her arms wide, welcoming the opportunity to experience the spell firsthand. He barely knew her and this felt like a fairly personal thing, but she was a human.

If Ilya was around, he might have asked her. Unfortunately, she and Olatt’an were on their way to the Marrowlands Fen in search of her people.

Ultimately, the deciding factor came down to one key thought that ran through Arkk’s mind. If something did happen, Vezta would be able to help him far more than the magical researcher. Trapping her in her body or *whatever* happened to someone while possessed was less than ideal.

“Ready?” Arkk asked, looking at Zullie.

“I’ve read about possession. Never experienced it, but it is supposedly the domain of ghosts or gods. Neither of which have physical forms, so I’m interested in seeing how this works out. Ghosts typically possess objects rather than people, but the latter has been documented. As for gods…” She shrugged. “They say the Light will possess the Holy Ecclesiarch in times of grave danger, but that hasn’t happened in my lifetime.”

“Alright. But are you ready?”

“I am completely focused on my internal magic in an attempt to uncover what will happen. Proceed at will.”

“*Cranium Internum*,” Arkk said. Not wanting to explode anyone, he carefully pushed out just a touch of magic toward Zullie, slowly increasing it until it felt like a bit of twine snapped between his fingers.

Arkk shook himself, wobbling slightly. Vezta reached out a hand, steadying him, but even after he regained his balance, he still felt off-kilter. His perspective was shorter than normal and his vision wasn’t as sharp as it usually was. His fingernails were too long, his chest was too heavy, and his back had developed a sudden ache.

Glancing down at himself, he didn’t see *himself* at all. Rather, he was clad in the black surcoat-like coat that Zullie wore. It left her arms bare—she said she didn’t like sleeves smudging ink—which was more than enough to realize that Arkk wasn’t at all Arkk anymore. His arms were thin and bookish.

Looking up, he saw Vezta smiling at him, but no sign of *him*.

“This is very strange,” he said, feeling like he needed to clear his throat.

*You think this is strange for you? You should see it from my perspective.*

“Zullie? Are you there?”

*I wonder where your body went. Gods don’t have bodies and neither do ghosts, so it makes sense that they would be able to enter another being—or object—but you most definitely had a flesh and blood meat sack carting around your consciousness until just now.*

“Please don’t refer to me as a meat sack,” Arkk said, then looked over to Vezta. “Is everything working properly?”

“I see no issue. You are fully in control of the body?”

Arkk held out a hand and drummed his fingers in the air. Slowly, he started walking around the library. His walk picked up into a light jog around the large desk. Surprisingly enough, despite his initial disorientation, he wasn’t having any trouble moving around. He had thought the smaller legs would have thrown him off, but once he started moving, it all came as naturally as if Zullie’s body had been his all along.

*Please stop. You’re getting me sweaty.*

Slowing down, not wanting to upset his magical researcher, Arkk stopped next to Vezta. From the information she had shoved into his mind when first teaching him the spell, he knew roughly how to end the spell. His magic was still being siphoned from him, slowly but surely. Pulling back on it for just a moment had him staggering in place.

Zullie almost toppled over, but Vezta’s quick movements saved them both from an unfortunate fall to the ground.

Back in his comfortable tunic, Arkk patted himself down, just making sure that everything was where it was supposed to be. Across from him, Zullie was doing much the same. Almost in the same patterns too, making him wonder if he was somehow still controlling her.

Then she opened her mouth.

“Fascinating,” she said, reaching for her pen. She somehow managed to speak and write at the same time. “Being a passenger in my own body is not anything I ever expected to experience. I could feel your magic thrumming through my bones. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to reassert control. I’ve heard of people fighting off ghostly possession but perhaps I need more experience…”

“I did hear you talking to me,” Arkk said. “Or talking to yourself. Not sure which. Once I started moving, it felt perfectly natural to walk around in your body.”

Zullie bobbed her head, adding his commentary to her notes. “We should soak you in water and then have you possess someone for an extended period of time.”

Arkk blinked. “Why?”

“I am curious to discover whether the water will have dried or if you will emerge as wet as you were before.”

“That makes sense. See if my body changes while it doesn’t… uh, exist? That could be vital if I get wounded. I could possess someone and ride their body around until I could reach someone capable of healing my body…” Arkk paused, an odd sense of disassociation hitting him. “This is also the strangest thing I’ve ever talked about.”

“Will you possess me now, Master?” Vezta asked, all of her eyes staring at him.

Arkk hesitated before slowly shaking his head. With how natural Zullie’s body had felt after a few minutes, he would probably get the hang of Vezta’s body, but… her body was just *so* very different. The thought of having so many eyes, limbs, and whatever minor shapeshifting ability she had to turn her thick tendrils into a long dress felt disorienting just imagining it.

“Later,” he said, not sure how much he meant it. Vezta accepted the response without any disappointment, just a slight bow of acknowledgment. “I actually had a job for Zullie. I’m sorry for disturbing your work. Both of you,” he said, looking from Vezta to Zullie. “But this could be important.”

“I live to serve,” Vezta said with another bow.

Zullie, on the other hand, shot him a dirty look. “Is this job related to your magic?”

“Not exactly.” Arkk winced at the flash of irritation in her violet eyes. “I’m planning to send some of the orcs to protect an expedition to some ancient pyramid. I would like it located and assessed before committing, however.”

“Assessed?”

“For danger as well as possible value in seeking it out. Lost magical knowledge, treasure, or anything similar.”

Zullie nodded with a small frown. “And you want me to do that? I thought… *Vezta* was our scrying professional. I can use a crystal ball, but—”

“Vezta is working on a different project for me,” Arkk said, looking at the monster for a moment before turning his attention back to Zullie. “If there is some pyramid out in the highlands, I assume it will be much easier to locate than a person. If you cannot locate it, it isn’t that big of a deal. I just prefer being forewarned about any dangers.”

“I suppose if I’m being paid to do this,” Zullie said, grumbling as she looked back to her notes. “You want me to pause the magic research?”

“Just for a few hours,” Arkk said, handing over his own notes on the mercenary job. “This is all the information I know. Spend at least a few hours today and tomorrow on it. If you haven’t found anything by nightfall tomorrow, you can stop.”

“Understood,” Zullie said with a sigh, looking over the notes. After a long moment, she walked over to the crystal ball in the library and hunched over it.

“Vezta…” Arkk said, thinking about what Rekk’ar had mentioned as he led her out of the room and away from Zullie. Once they were down the hall, he asked, “There are other fortresses like this, right?”

“Today? I do not know, but I doubt it. In the days of my former master? I wouldn’t have said they were common, but there were certainly a number around.”

“Do you know if there was one in the Cliff mountainside? The magical academy there reminds me a lot of this place.”

“The location you visited recently?” Vezta hummed. “It wasn’t called Cliff at the time, but I do believe that there was a Keeper of the [HEART] operating in the area. Malachite? Mendechaus, perhaps? I suppose whoever it was is long dead.”

“I wonder if I should make a contract with it next time I am there—”

Vezta started, actually losing her smile as she gripped Arkk’s arm. “Do not claim an unknown [HEART], Master. Your [HEART] is your heart.”

“Wasn’t I supposed to claim more for your *other* task?”

“Yes, but not on a whim…” Vezta trailed off, eyes shifting away from Arkk for a moment. “If you wish to merely expand your territory beyond great distances, beseeching the [PANTHEON] is the proper method. Other Keepers are known to lay traps, sabotage, or otherwise make it unpleasant for others to take what is theirs. In addition, there are many types of [HEART] devices and not all are compatible with each other. I *must* protest any action toward another [HEART]. If you discover one, inactive, we can assess it together.”

Never in the several weeks that Arkk had known Vezta had she used such passion and fervor while speaking. In tense situations, such as nearly being overwhelmed by goblins, she always used a demure tone with a serene smile on her face. Even when discussing her former master’s final orders and her desire to see them through, she had spoken with a reserved reverence, not anything like *this*.

“Besides,” Vezta said, slowly returning to a calmer state. “It is highly likely that any [HEART] in the area is already dead.”

Arkk, licking his lips, drew a breath and asked, “Why do you say that?”

“Have you forgotten what the surface looks like here? If there are people and plants near a still-living [HEART], I would be surprised. Unless, of course, someone claimed it or the [HEART] discovered another method of survival. I cannot rule either out, but find it unlikely given the location and population.”

“Hearts would be in other Cursed Forests,” Arkk said with a frown. “I understand.”

Vezta nodded, looking relieved. “I apologize for my outburst, Master. I merely wished to impress upon you the gravity of the situation.”

“No, it’s fine. There is a lot I don’t know and I appreciate you warning me before I bumble into problems. I was just thinking it would be nice to be able to teleport around Cliff at will… Vezta, are there more of your kind around? Perhaps near the fortress of this possible dead Heart?”

“If there are, I have not heard of such a thing.” Vezta smiled. “I would not be surprised to find that I am the last of my kind on this plane.”

“That’s… I’m sorry.”

“Sorry?” Vezta shook her head, side to side. “I suppose it is a bit too peaceful like this.” Arkk raised an eyebrow, but Vezta simply bowed.

Shrugging, Arkk asked, “How is opening the portal coming along?”

Vezta clasped her hands together, rubbing a thumb against the back of her hand. “Not as well as I had hoped. I aim to recruit your magical researcher to my efforts, but she is still familiarizing herself with magic and life here. Perhaps… ask me for a progress report in two weeks?”

“I can do that.” Arkk nodded, then asked. “And the other task I assigned to you?”

“Scrying for the girl? I had something to report on that matter. I searched through the Darkwood forest. It appears incompatible with human existence, being filled with dangers I don’t believe any individual is likely to survive. Because of that, I focused a great deal on the burg. I spotted someone matching the description you gave me.”

“You found her?” Arkk perked up. His whole plan to get invited to the Duke’s party revolved around making a name for themselves. Rescuing a viscount’s daughter was their ticket to that renown.

Vezta held up a hand with a small frown. “There was an issue. I spotted a woman, but she possesses an artifact of some type that allows her to hide from my sight.”

“Hide how?”

“Invisibility.”

“Is that possible?” Arkk said, eyes widening.

“My former master has a spell that would allow that, but from what I observed of your missing woman, she possesses an article of clothing with a similar spell effect woven into it.”

Invisibility could be a problem, but… “She is there, right?”

“As of this afternoon, yes.”

“Then I’ll leave at once. If she shows again, alert me and I’ll focus on you and your crystal ball.”

Vezta canted her head. “If I were there in person, I imagine I would be able to track her.”

Arkk bit his lip then shook his head. “No. The inquisitors will be searching for any sightings of you. I need you to keep things running here anyway. With Olatt’an out, it’s just you and Rekk’ar. Luckily, we’re sending a few orcs out to that ancient pyramid, some are with Ilya, and I’ll be taking a few as well. There won’t be too many here.”

“Understood,” Vezta said with a bow. Her movements were the same as they ever were, but Arkk still felt a hint of disappointment in her tone. “If there is nothing else, I shall see to the tasks you assigned me.”

“No, that’s all. Thank you, Vezta.”

She bowed again before turning. Arkk watched her back—and the array of glowing yellow eyes that traveled down her spine—for a long moment until she turned down a different corridor. Pressing his lips into a small frown, Arkk turned and, after a few steps, teleported away.

## 25 - Darkwood Burg


“Not the friendliest place, is it?” Dakka asked, eyes traveling over the muddy road and the few poor souls who had ventured out into the moderate rain.

Arkk didn’t say anything as he pulled his heavy cloak a little tighter, but he agreed in full.

Darkwood Burg wasn’t a particularly well-to-do settlement. Arkk would never compare a regular burg to an actual city like Cliff, but even compared to a backwater like Smilesville, Darkwood was lacking. The quality of the buildings wasn’t anywhere near that of other burgs, the people walked with their heads down and only glanced up to look at newcomers with suspicion, and its surrounding farmlands were smaller and far less healthy than others Arkk had seen—though with several of the fields being empty from the recent harvest, maybe Arkk shouldn’t judge too harshly.

The wall was the only truly impressive aspect of the burg. A thick stone wall wrapped around the entire settlement. Most burgs contained a larger keep where the local lord sat, which might have some amount of important structures enclosed within the wall but was otherwise fairly insular. Beyond the keep, the rest of most burgs were regular villages that spread out from the walls.

Darkwood Burg had a large keep in the center along with a hefty wall, but a second, larger wall surrounded every other building. On the way in, Arkk spotted less than five buildings outside the wall.

Part of that, Arkk figured, was its location. Darkwood was so named for the nearby Darkwoods, a particularly nasty bit of terrain filled with all manner of unpleasant creatures. Or so Arkk had gathered from asking about the area over the last few days that he and his group had been traveling. Among the many dangers, there were known goblin infestations, an insect colony that tended to leave people alone until they didn’t, occasional sightings of ghasts, and it was a known hunting ground for raptors. A necromancer had allegedly called the area home well over a hundred years ago and, while he had been slain, there were still rumors of undead wandering and attacking anything living they came across.

With all that, one might wonder why anyone bothered to live here. The lumber harvested from the forest, which was a rich, near-black hardwood, was a valuable and rare luxury for the wealthy. Too valuable, it seemed, for the locals to build their homes out of it.

Arkk and Dakka came to a stop outside a small, unassuming building. The signboard on the wall lacked text but did possess a rather intricate carving of an alchemical alembic and several stoppered vials.

“This it?”

“Yes,” Arkk said with a frown. “Check around the sides for other entrances. Watch them if there are any, otherwise return and wait here.”

“Sure thing. Orjja,” Dakka said, pointing, “left side. Farr’an, with her. I’ll take the right.”

As the three orcs spread out, Arkk pushed open the door, tossing his hood off as he stepped out of the rain.

The smell hit him first. An unpleasant sting of a dozen different concoctions. The potion fumes were thick enough in the air that Arkk felt a need to leave the door open lest he suffocate entirely. Wafting a hand in front of his face, a useless gesture, he pressed forward. There were living people in here and if they could survive the air, he could as well. He wasn’t about to be stopped by a foul smell.

Stepping past dusty shelves filled with aging bottles of colored liquids, Arkk approached a wide counter. A person stood behind it, cloaked in thick black clothes. The individual wore a full face-concealing mask. Dark lenses allowed sight while a long, beak-like protrusion jutted out from the mouth and nose area. The attire revealed no skin and no hair, but Arkk did note the gloves had a few too many fingers as the person poured sticky, black liquid from a wide metal pan with a notch on one side into a small glass jar.

Arkk waited, not wanting to disturb the alchemist and cause them to spill whatever that potion was. He simply looked around, noting a raven perched on a thin dowel behind the counter. Several pots and cauldrons were propped up on a stone firepit against the back wall, though there was no fire lit at the moment.

Eventually, the alchemist ceased pouring the black liquid and promptly stoppered the glass jar and covered the larger pot with a metal lid. Placing both containers to the side, the alchemist clasped their many fingers together, gently placing his gloved hands on the countertop.

“Apologies. Thank you for waiting,” they whispered, voice muffled behind the mask. “How can I serve you? Perhaps I can interest you in a soakless solution to keep the rain off your cloak?”

“Tempting,” Arkk said honestly. He almost coughed as he breathed in but, now that there was a lid on whatever potion the alchemist had been brewing, the air had started to clear. “But I’m here for information today.”

“Ah. Interested in learning the art of alchemy yourself?” They leaned forward, whispering voice speaking with a little more intensity. “It is a rewarding discipline, but mistakes can cost you dearly. You would not believe how annoying it is to get gloves made with eight fingers,” they said, holding up their hand and wiggling around the extra digits.

“That’s…” That wasn’t what he had come here for, but couldn’t help himself. “Are you offering personal tutoring or books?”

“I do not recognize you. You are a traveler. Unless you are planning on staying in Darkwood for a significant amount of time, I would not be able to offer an apprenticeship that would teach you anything effective.”

“You are correct. I hope to not be in the area for more than a few days.”

“In that case,” they said, turning away. They walked over behind some curtains hanging off to the side of the counter. Leaning forward, Arkk spotted a tall series of shelves filled with a number of books and small bits of equipment. They pulled off a worn and weathered book that was less a proper tome and more a collection of papers haphazardly bound together with thin pieces of twine. Returning to the counter, they placed it down. “This is what got me my start. It is a fairly simple treatise with a small collection of recipes that can all be brewed in a simple cooking pot, so no need for any exotic equipment. Perfect for beginners.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow. “How do you know I’m in the market for something for beginners?”

“You still have both your eyebrows,” they said with a wispy laugh.

After staring for a moment, Arkk shrugged. “Fair enough. That sounds perfect. What are you asking for it?”

“Let’s say…” they trailed off, humming in thought. Far too many fingers drummed against the counter before their beak-like mask dipped in a nod. “Thirty-four of the King’s stamped silvers.”

There wasn’t a hard exchange rate from gold to silvers. At least not *his* gold. On the way to Cliff, he had exchanged several pieces of gold for a few pouches of silver with a few of the wealthier merchants he had come across, simply to make it easier to pay for things elsewhere without having to haggle over the value of his gold. The best rate he got was one gold piece for thirty silvers. The worst had been one for thirteen.

Arkk fished a pair of gold coins from inside his cloak. Knowing he was going to pay for the actual information he had come here for, he didn’t want to hand over every single silver that he had.

The alchemist picked up one of the pieces of gold, holding it up to the dark lens in their mask before dropping it into a small glass bowl on the counter. The other coin went on one side of a set of scales. Ducking underneath the counter, the alchemist returned with a bottle of clear liquid and a thin glass straw. After dipping the straw into the clear liquid, the alchemist placed their finger over the other end. When they lifted the straw, a small amount of liquid remained suspended in the bottom until, holding the straw over the gold coin, they removed their finger. The liquid fell out, landing on top of the gold coin. A few sizzling bubbles appeared on the surface of the coin, but only for a brief moment. In short order, the liquid calmed and stilled until it looked no different from water.

“I do not recognize the stamp, but this is quite pure gold.” The alchemist leaned down to the scale, adding a few weights to the other side until the coin was evenly balanced. “Very well. This will suffice.” Reaching under the counter again, the alchemist pulled up a thin section of animal hide and began wrapping the treatise. “I would hate to see it damaged by the rain.”

“Thank you,” Arkk said. He placed another three gold coins on the countertop. “But I originally came here for a different type of information.”

“Oh?” the alchemist asked, tying a piece of twine around the hide-bound book before sliding it across the counter toward Arkk. They did not touch the new coins, however. “What might that be?”

“There was a woman here about nine days ago. Young with dark skin and curly white hair, wearing a green cloak,” Arkk said, repeating the information Vezta had given him before he left the fortress. “I would like to know about her.”

The alchemist slowly shook their head. “I receive a great many customers. My services are in high demand within Darkwood.”

“You brewed a violet-hued potion for her. It took an hour and she stood by in that corner over there, watching until it was finished,” Arkk said. He dropped ten more coins onto the pile. “She tried to pay you with a few silvers, but you refused.”

The pointed beak of the alchemist’s mask dipped down to the counter before they looked back toward Arkk. “It sounds as if you know a great deal already.”

“She returned every day for the next three days and then two days after that. She brought you lunch,” Arkk said. She had just sat and talked, spending almost the entire day here. “I believe she is the daughter of a viscount, kidnapped and currently missing. Her father is worried about her.”

The alchemist took in a deep breath. “Sir—”

Arkk pulled out a fistful of gold, nearly doubling the size of the pile.

The alchemist just shook their head. “You can pile gold onto the counter all day long. It won’t change what I know, which seems to be a fair deal less than you.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, staring into the mask’s dark lenses. Eventually, he dipped his head with a small sigh. While scraping the pile of coins back into his pouch, he left one on the counter. “Sorry,” he said, then slid the extra coin toward the alchemist. “An apology for harassing you. I’ve just been worried for her. Whoever kidnapped her… well, they seem to be the worst sort imaginable.”

When the alchemist said nothing, Arkk picked up the wrapped book and headed back toward the door. Pausing, he looked back.

“If you do recall anything, I am staying at the local stayover for another few days.”

Stepping outside, Arkk threw his hood on and then took a deep breath of fresh air.

Dakka, Orjja, and Farr’an were casually leaning against the adjacent building, talking with each other. None looked like they were watching the entrance in the slightest, yet all three subtly shifted the moment Arkk stepped out. Heading in the opposite direction, he turned a corner; they followed after a few moments.

“Nothing?”

“Just the one door,” Dakka said. “Rainy day like this and nobody’s walking around either. Street was deserted the whole time you were inside.”

Nodding, Arkk reached inside his cloak and pulled out a crystal ball.

He had taken the crystal ball on the trip to watch the shop on the way. Both he and Vezta had been unable to discover where the woman had been going before and after the potion shop. She had a cloak that rendered her invisible to scrying, and possibly regular vision as well, though Arkk hadn’t yet seen her in person to test that.

Quite the suspicious item—and activities—for someone supposedly kidnapped. There were only two reasons why a young woman would be kidnapped. Ransom or lust. The former could be ruled out as no ransom notice had been given to her father. The latter made Arkk irrationally angry just thinking about it, but he felt that could be ruled out as well. No matter the reason why someone had been kidnapped, they wouldn’t be allowed to roam around with a magical item.

Still, Arkk didn’t think she had escaped either. The notice of her kidnapping had been posted weeks ago and the sighting of her in Darkwood was old as well. Yet she was still here. Or had been several days ago. If she had gone to a city guard and mentioned the reward for her safe return, she would have been in Cliff by now.

Which meant she hadn’t been kidnapped at all.

Arkk motioned toward the crystal ball, lighting it up with a touch of magic. The alchemist appeared inside, standing over the counter. They hadn’t gone back to their work with the sticky black potion but were instead using a single one of their many fingers to roll the gold coin back and forth on its edge.

Arkk waited, watching the crystal ball. *Hoping*. For over an hour, the alchemist didn’t move. They just stood there, fiddling with the gold coin. Eventually, however, the alchemist picked up the coin, palming it in their fist. They stepped around the counter and carefully approached the door. Opening the door just a crack, they peered out into the rainy street, slowly opening the door wider to see further. With the door opened enough to step through, the alchemist looked around. Upon spotting nobody, they grabbed a cloak from near the door, pulled it up over their head and mask, and stepped outside.

“Alright,” Arkk said, alerting the orcs around him. “It’s time. Let’s see where you’re going…”

Using the crystal ball to remain entirely out of sight while keeping a watch on the alchemist made following them through the burg almost too easy. Arkk felt like he should at least be trying to sneak around, yet he and three lumbering orcs walked out in the open because they knew exactly where their target was even while remaining a street away.

The alchemist was at least trying to be careful. Arkk did have to give them credit for that. With how much they were looking around and ducking down side streets and alleys, anyone without a crystal ball either would have lost the alchemist or they would have been caught.

As it was, they managed to follow the alchemist to a rundown old single-room building on the opposite side of the city.

The alchemist started pacing out front, so Arkk quickly checked inside the home. “Found her,” he said, watching as the woman who he presumed to be the viscount’s daughter stirred a stew hanging over a small fire in the fireplace. The alchemist knocked and she *jolted*, tensing so quickly that the ladle went flying from her fingertips, spilling stew across the floor.

From his position around the side of a small house, Arkk couldn’t hear the conversation, but he could see the woman speaking through the door. She almost melted in relief when she realized who it was. Which Arkk took as a good sign. If this wasn’t Gretchen, the viscount’s daughter, after all this sneaking about, he would be beyond surprised.

As Gretchen opened the door, the alchemist glanced around one last time before stepping in.

He did a quick scan of the interior, but there wasn’t much space in there to check. A bed, a table, a few stools, and a bookshelf with many alchemical texts. The latter fact made him wonder if the home belonged to the alchemist, though he hadn’t seen the alchemist return here in all the time Arkk spent watching him.

“Check doors again,” Arkk said, rounding the corner and hurrying up to the small home. “She might be invisible. If a door opens and you don’t see anything, try to block the way as best you can.”

“Orjja, left. Farr’an, right. If there are more doors and windows than you two can guard on your own, let me know. I’ll ensure no one comes out the front.”

“Remember, we aren’t trying to harm her,” Arkk said, still watching the crystal ball. “And we need to hurry. The alchemist is probably telling her to go on the run again. With that cloak of hers, we might never find her.”

It had been, frankly, a stroke of luck that Vezta decided to search the burg as well as the neighboring forest. Repeating that wouldn’t be easy.

While the two orcs moved around the building, Arkk walked right up to the front door. For a moment, he considered walking in but decided against it. Startling them might cause a fight. A knock, on the other hand, would give them a moment to steady and prepare. Maybe prepare to fight, maybe prepare to flee. With the crystal ball in hand and the orcs watching two windows around the back, Arkk felt prepared for either eventuality.

Both jumped at the knock. The alchemist moved to put Gretchen behind his back, standing in front of her with their arm raised to shield her. Arkk almost missed it at the first glance, but the alchemist had a pair of glass vials held between the fingers of their outstretched hand, looking ready to throw them. Yet another confirmation that barging right in would have been a bad idea. Even as it was, Arkk wished that the fortress was nearby if only to have an easy escape via teleportation if things took a turn for the worse.

When no one did barge through, the alchemist said something to Gretchen, who quickly donned the invisibility cloak, revealing a small coat stand that had been concealed by its power. It was an interesting effect. Not as great as the [HEART] and its construction, teleportation, and employee utilities, but if the cloak was the first magical artifact Arkk had ever seen, his jaw would have been dragging along the floor. As soon as Gretchen was fully hidden, the alchemist stepped closer to the door.

“Good evening,” Arkk said when the door opened a crack.

The alchemist started. Their face was still hidden behind their mask, but the jolt that ran through their whole body gave it away. The lenses of their mask glinted as they looked up to the side where Dakka stood, arms crossed.

“We’ll draw less attention inside,” Arkk said with a smile. “Unless you would prefer attention. I know we are not the only ones looking for Miss Gretchen.”

That wasn’t even a lie. In the two days he and Dakka had been in town, they had asked around. With the amount of money the Viscount was offering, it was no surprise that every bounty hunter in the region had gravitated around Darkwood.

“Miss… who?” the alchemist whispered. “Sir, I think—”

Arkk lifted the crystal ball. It was in front of him already, between the door and his body, but he wouldn’t be surprised to find the large beak of the mask had blocked the view. Now, however, the crystal clear image of the interior of the single-room home was clear to see.

The alchemist’s shoulders dropped. “I see.” Opening the door wider, they stepped aside. “Come in quickly, I suppose.”

Dakka immediately moved, repositioning herself to completely block the now wide-open door.  She stepped in first, ducking her head under the doorway, with Arkk following right behind. He closed the door, ensuring no invisible woman slipped past. As Arkk stepped further into the small living space, Dakka took up position behind him, still blocking the door. He quickly checked the crystal ball, noting Orjja and Farr’an outside the two shuttered windows, making sure to linger on both long enough for anyone paying attention to notice. Slipping the crystal ball into a leather pouch under his cloak, Arkk looked up with a smile.

“I think the stew might be burning,” he said, tone as calm and casual as possible. The potions in the alchemist’s hands weren’t visible at the moment, but he wanted to avoid doing anything that might get those thrown at him, unsure what they might do. “Please relax. Gretchen, I’m not here to drag you back to your father. Probably.”

A slight gasp from the corner of the room had both Arkk and Dakka shifting, though neither moved.

Eventually, just to the left of where Arkk was looking, Gretchen shuffled off her cloak, leaving it around her shoulders but letting it hang loose with her hood off. Arkk expected to see fear on her face but was surprised to see that she looked about ready to attack anyone that came near. Probably with the ladle she had picked up sometime between now and when she had dropped it.

“What do you mean, *probably*?”

“Were you ever kidnapped? Are you being held here against your will? Are you in danger here? Are you hiding here from someone and are unable to return to your father?”

With each question, Gretchen shook her head back and forth.

Sighing, Arkk asked one final question. “Do you *want* to go back to your father?”

“No,” she said, almost as a hiss. “That *bastard* can—” Cutting herself off, she threw an angry glance at the wall, refusing to look at anyone.

Arkk exchanged a glance with Dakka. “Could always drag her back anyway. Not like they can stop us,” the orc said.

“No, no,” Arkk said, noting both the alchemist and Gretchen tense. “We’re trying to rescue someone. I doubt Ilya would be happy knowing we boosted our fame at the expense of someone else. And that’s assuming she didn’t kill me first.”

Gretchen looked up at that. “Rescue someone?” she asked.

Arkk shrugged his shoulders. “We hoped to return you to your father would make us notable enough—perhaps with a little help from your father’s connections—to open a few doors that are currently closed to us. I honestly thought finding you would be the hard part. Now…” With a sigh, Arkk gestured toward the pot of stew. “Why not take that off the fire and then let us sit down and discuss a few things? Maybe we can turn this around and somehow not make it a big waste of time.”

## 26 - The Viscount's Daughter


“To summarize,” Arkk said, rubbing the side of his forehead. “Your father wants to marry you off and you object, so you ran away.”

Gretchen, seated on an old wicker stool, nodded with a hefty scowl wrinkling her face. “It isn’t just *marry me off*. I might have been happy to do it if it was someone agreeable. Earl Pritchard is eighty-five, has had six wives, and three of those wives have died in what I might call suspicious circumstances.” She shook her head. “The age difference alone is enough to make me vomit. I might have been able to put up with it for a few years if it meant I was able to claim his estate—he has no heirs—but I don’t intend to die for it.”

Arkk just frowned. “I assume the Earl offered something to your father in exchange?”

“Maybe. Maybe he’s just doing an old friend a favor.”

“Would he be open to alternate offers?”

Gretchen, who had been listlessly stirring a bowl of stew, froze as she shot Arkk an appraising look.

“Not for marriage!” Arkk said the moment he realized what he said. “I wouldn’t marry you.”

Gretchen huffed. “Well.”

“Not…” Arkk held up both hands, index fingers slightly raised more than the rest. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m sure you’re a lovely woman but I don’t know you at all.”

“That hardly seems to be a requirement,” Gretchen said, scowl deepening. “I’ve never even met Earl Pritchard.”

“It matters to me. I would pay your father a great deal of money to not marry you.”

Gretchen’s eyes flashed in irritation. Dakka just started chuckling behind Arkk.

Arkk, rubbing his neck, cleared his throat. “What I mean to say is that I want to take you back to your father. As someone who thinks he has a proper sense of morality—not to mention a growing dislike for almost everyone I’ve heard of with a noble title—I don’t want to force you back. Especially if it means you’ll get… murdered?”

“How considerate,” Gretchen said, tone utterly flat.

“The Viscount clearly intends to collect more than he is offering for Gretchen’s return,” the alchemist said in a whisper. “You can pay that and more?”

“I’m… independently wealthy.”

“Why?”

Arkk blinked at Gretchen’s question. “Why… am I wealthy?”

“Why spend all this wealth on me? Especially if you don’t intend to… marry me.”

“Oh.” Arkk shrugged. “I need the renown.”

“Renown?”

“Clout. Prestige. Glory. Fame. Notability. Whatever you call it, I need it. The Duke has these parties every so often and I want in. Returning victorious with a viscount’s kidnapped daughter sounded like a great way to get my foot in the door.”

Disgust crossed Gretchen’s features as she looked from Arkk to Dakka and back. “You want to go to one of those parties? I’ve been twice and neither time has been particularly pleasant.”

“My best friend’s mother was taken by the Duke. We want to get her back. That’s the best idea we’ve got right now.”

“I’m… so sorry.”

“We found her,” Arkk hurried to reassure her. “She’s safe. We just can’t get to her. Or get her out of there.” He was about to ask about the circumstances under which Gretchen might be willing to return to her father, only to pause as a thought occurred to him. “Could your father get us into one of those parties? Or would helping him even help us? I guess I should ask that. If the answer is no, there is no point in even talking about this any further.”

Gretchen didn’t answer right away, frowning to herself as she resumed stirring her stew. She hadn’t offered Arkk, Dakka, or even the alchemist any. While it smelled alright, he had eaten before setting out for the alchemist’s workshop and would have refused the offer anyway.

“You are doing a job for my father. He is not the kind of person to recognize achievements in service. You’ll get your pay and he’ll send you on your way.” Gretchen paused, ate a spoonful of stew, then continued. “I’m not just saying that to get you to leave me alone either. It’s the truth.”

Arkk sighed, leaning back against the wall of the small cottage. Had this all been a waste of time? Although for the wrong reasons, Rekk’ar might have been right in rejecting this job outright.

Taking the lull in conversation to think, he spent a moment checking in on his other employees and Fortress Al-Mir. Rekk’ar was in a training room, apparently instructing the few orcs who were still at the fortress. Five others were camping out in the highlands, accompanied by an elf and a human. They were the group headed to that ancient pyramid. Arkk didn’t necessarily expect anything to come of that expedition, but so long as no real incidents occurred, it was a good way to get the orcs some exercise.

Ilya and Olatt’an’s group of ten were on a small riverboat. It had been over two weeks since they set off for the Marrowlands Fen and they had only just arrived in the general area in the last day. Increasingly worried about them, Arkk had been checking in at regular intervals. He didn’t think there was much he could do to assist from a distance if they did wind up in trouble, but checking on them made him feel marginally better.

Vezta and Zullie were both in the fortress, together at that, inside the room with the large crystal archway. It was the portal, he knew, or at least it had been at one point in time. Arkk wasn’t quite sure how Zullie was going to help with that. Vezta seemed like the kind of person capable of accomplishing her task on her own, but then again, Vezta had already admitted a deficiency in magical knowledge.

How soon would he be able to open the portal? Vezta had mentioned potential assistance coming from the other side. Beings and boons granted by the Cloak of Shadows and other members of her [PANTHEON]. With this plan to rapidly boost their renown being a bust, he started considering what his next plan might look like.

According to Vezta, the [PANTHEON] would be able to grant remote extensions to his territory. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what form that would come in, but if he could plant an extension within range of Cliff, thus allowing for teleportation *out* of the city, hiring Alya would be all he needed to teleport her out of the Duke’s manor. Of course, that meant he still needed to *reach* her. Or someone he was associated with, so long as an agreement for service occurred on his behalf.

Arkk jolted out of his reflections on his other employees, startled by Dakka clapping a hand on his shoulder.

“Your eyes were red,” she whispered, nodding her head toward the other two in the room.

“Honestly didn’t realize my eyes were open,” Arkk whispered back as he took in the wary look of alarm on Gretchen’s face. The alchemist’s face was still covered by their full mask, but Arkk read their readiness for fight-or-flight in their posture. “Sorry,” he said. “Didn’t mean to startle you. I was just thinking.”

“Does that happen often?” the alchemist whispered.

“Increasingly,” Dakka said.

Arkk just shrugged. He was about to say something when he felt a strong tug on the link between him and his employees. Jolting, fearing that Ilya had run into trouble, he followed the link only to find himself drawn to Orjja, standing just outside the small shack. With a wince, he realized that he should have invited the other two inside once it became clear that Gretchen wasn’t going to try running if only to keep his employees out of the rain.

When he noticed the reason for Orjja tugging on the link, he realized what a stroke of luck it was that he *had* left them out there.

People were approaching the shack.

Not just any people, but ones he recognized from the stayover. Other bounty hunters and mercenaries.

Arkk started wondering how they were here only to grimace as realization hit. While following the alchemist, he hadn’t bothered trying to hide, secure in knowing that the alchemist wouldn’t be able to notice them. Someone else would have been able to follow *him* without trouble. And of course people would. After having asked around at the stayover, people knew that he was after Gretchen just as much as any of them.

“It appears as if we have company,” Arkk said, guessing that his eyes had flashed red again based on the expressions around him. Ignoring them, Arkk pulled out the crystal ball. While his employee vision was useful, it wasn’t as versatile as a proper crystal ball. “Five armed men, all bearing an emblem of… is that a goose?”

Dakka, peering down into the crystal ball, shrugged. “Ferocious creatures.”

“I guess.”

“Time to go, I suppose?”

Arkk nodded his head, pushing off from the wall he had been leaning against. He froze as he spotted the horrified look on Gretchen’s face.

“You’re leaving? Just like that?” she asked, voice tense.

Arkk grimaced. There had been nothing here for him in the first place. Now knowing that, there was no reason to stick around any longer or get into a fight with a group of bounty hunters that, as a fellow mercenary, he should theoretically be at least on speaking terms with. Even if he fought them off, word would spread and others would show up eventually.

“I feel bad about leading them here, but… Can’t you just hide under your cloak like you had been planning when I showed up?” Arkk asked with a small sigh.

With what the Viscount was offering for her return, anyone looking for her wasn’t likely to leave this building or the alchemist in peace if they thought either were relevant. She wouldn’t have been able to stay hidden forever. With him having dragged bounty hunters to her doorstep, the time she had left shrank abruptly.

Gretchen knew that as well. He could see it in her eyes.

“Maybe I could claim you as my bounty, getting rid of them for now, then have you *escape* on the way to Cliff?”

Gretchen bit her lip, shooting a look at the alchemist. There was something in her eyes there as well, making Arkk wonder if some romance had blossomed since running away from her father. It would help explain this house she lived in. It was either the alchemist’s home or simply one they had been able to procure for Gretchen. Arkk wasn’t sure which.

“Can she trust you?” the alchemist whispered, stepping closer.

“If I still wanted to take her back to her father at this point, I wouldn’t even be having this conversation.”

“Why not hire them?” Dakka asked absently, drawing her axe as she peered into the crystal ball. “Nobody would find them in the fortress.”

The idea had occurred to Arkk. The alchemist in particular had skills that he was sure he could make use of. Especially if he could make a top-of-the-line potion brewery using the fortress magic. Gretchen, however, didn’t have any skills he thought he would need. Not that skill was a requirement to be hired, but it was a factor. “I can’t just hire everyone I come across,” Arkk said, shaking his head. There was a much bigger reason why he couldn’t just hire everyone he spotted. “The alchemist has a shop here. They have lives here—”

“Had,” Dakka said. At his pointed look, she gave an unapologetic shrug. “They’re almost here. Better at least hide for now if you don’t want to get caught.”

With one last gnawing of her lips, Gretchen rushed to the rack and threw her invisibility cloak over herself.

“Dakka, stand in the corner, leaning against the wall. Gretchen, hide behind her. That will keep them from bumping into you.”

“Sure thing, boss,” Dakka said, moving to the wall. Her large hand felt around in the air until it bumped into something solid. Nodding, she angled herself such that there was a small corner behind her where Gretchen could stand.

“Alchemist,” Arkk said, pulling out the wrapped treatise that he had bought earlier.

“Morford.”

“Excuse me?”

“My name. Morford. If you’re helping, might as well have you call me by name.”

Arkk nodded slowly, waiting a moment. This seemed like the kind of situation where the alchemist would pull off their mask and reveal themselves. When they didn’t, Arkk continued. “Is this your home?”

“It is.”

Arkk frowned at that. In the time he had been observing the alchemist in search of Gretchen, the alchemist hadn’t left their shop. They slept there and took meals there, mostly delivered by Gretchen. Assuming that they had been steering clear of the place for her sake, Arkk shrugged. “You invited me here to tutor me. We’ll—”

Two heavy thumps against the door rattled the entire small home. Arkk quickly crossed the floor, taking up Gretchen’s stool. He opened the treatise to a random page as if he had been reading from it and, leaving it open on his lap, picked up the half-eaten bowl of stew. As he did so, the alchemist, *Morford*, crossed the room and opened the door just as they had done when Arkk had been the one knocking.

Unlike when Arkk had knocked, those on the other side of the door forced it open the moment the alchemist undid the latch.

Three men barged in. The other two, he knew, were outside in a tense standoff with Orjja and Farr’an. Neither side had come to blows yet, but it wouldn’t take much to set them off.

“Where is she?” one of the bounty hunters asked. They didn’t have anything like the White Company’s uniforms. Just the goose emblem somewhere on their outfits. If Arkk had passed them on the street, he doubted he would have looked twice at them. The only reason Arkk recognized them as bounty hunters was that he had seen them in the stayover. He had spoken to the bald one on the left, asking about Gretchen.

“She?” Morford whispered, masked face shifting to the side.

“They must be talking about Gretchen,” Arkk said with a frown. “The First Legion, was it?” A grandiose name considering they were just a small group. From what Arkk had gathered, there were only ten members in total.

“We know you were looking for her.”

Giving them a flat look, Arkk nodded his head. “Yes. I mentioned that.” Arkk paused, then frowned. “Were you following me in the hopes that I would do your job for you? If the girl had been here, she would have been my bounty. Not yours.”

The apparent leader of the group, a shorter man with a thick mustache, sneered while the other two started poking around the place. It wasn’t a large place. There were only two hiding spots. Under the bed and under the table, the latter of which wouldn’t have saved anyone from one who simply leaned over.

“I heard the alchemist here had contact with Gretchen, but upon finding nothing, I elected to receive some tutoring in the subject of alchemy. It has always interested me,” Arkk said with a half-shrug, keeping his tone cool and casual even as the bounty hunters tried scouring the tiny home.

The First Legion didn’t seem all that impressed or convinced. Hawkwood had warned him about this. A vast number of mercenaries weren’t exactly pleasant people. Thieves trying to claim legitimacy, former soldiers who only knew war, people who wanted an excuse to shove around those weaker than them… For every Hawkwood in the business, patient and willing to help out as he was, there were ten thugs ready to backstab everyone else for a quick coin.

One of the bounty hunters got a bit too close to Dakka. She bared her tusks and, when he didn’t back off, she slammed her fist into his face.

Of the remaining two, one drew a cudgel while the other drew a sword.

“*Electro Deus*.”

Two lightning bolts leaped from his fingertips, striking each before they could take a step toward Dakka. They weren’t full-power bolts capable of frying them. That didn’t stop their muscles from seizing up, forcing them into heaps with small bits of steam wafting off their rain-soaked clothing.

The alchemist jumped back. He heard a startled squeak from Gretchen behind Dakka. Although Arkk winced at the sound, none of the three were in any state to pay attention to their surroundings.

Interestingly enough, the only one of the three who didn’t get back on their feet in short order was the one Dakka had punched.

“You barge in here, harass us, *and* thought you might steal my job?” Arkk ignored that he had done practically the same things, minus the last offense. With a shake of his head, he wiggled a finger back and forth, letting the lightning still sparking on the tip do a lot of the talking. “I’ve turned goblins to ash before. That was the *least* I can do. Attack us again. I dare you.” Arkk paused just long enough for the sparks at his fingertips to die out, then he started again. “*Electro De*—”

“No! No…” With an angry snarl, muscles in his neck twitching, the leader of the First Legion grabbed the one Dakka had punched and hauled him to his feet. None of the three were entirely steady, but they made their way back to the door and quickly rushed out.

“Nice meeting you!” Arkk called out with forced cheer as the alchemist closed the door. His shoulders slumped the moment they were gone and he let out a long breath. “Making friends already,” he mumbled.

“Friends,” Dakka scoffed. “If you want, we can drag them back for a proper fight. They can’t have gotten far.”

Arkk just shook his head, barely avoiding rolling his eyes at her quip, before settling his gaze on the spot behind Dakka. The orc still hadn’t moved, but the smaller girl behind her had thrown off her hood creating the odd effect of a floating head peering around the side of Dakka’s spiked shield.

Aside from the noise she had made, which hopefully nobody would remember after they had a chance to get their bearings, she had been utterly undetectable. If Dakka hadn’t been standing in the corner, maybe nobody would have walked over there in the first place. She could have hidden there until they left.

Arkk had to wonder at its limitations. Were there spells that could pierce that invisibility? If so, were such spells commonly used? Perhaps not among mercenaries, but among guards of noblemen’s keeps? How hard was it to get an invisibility cloak like that?

Turning his head to the alchemist, who was now peering through a crack in the door, presumably watching the First Legion flee, Arkk considered his earlier question about a soakless solution. Something, presumably, to keep rain from soaking into cloth. “Morford. Is invisibility something that you can brew and apply to cloth like a soakless solution?”

The beaked mask turned first to Gretchen then over to Arkk. Morford didn’t respond right away, going a bit stiff. Arkk had to bite back at his frown, especially once he realized that Gretchen hadn’t come out from around Dakka yet and wasn’t making any move to do so. Rather, she was barely peeking out from around the large shield, looking at Arkk with narrowed eyes.

Was it the spell? Hopefully, they didn’t think he was going to hit *them* with lightning bolts. Maybe they knew enough to recognize that it was some forbidden magic that the inquisitors didn’t like.

“No,” the alchemist eventually whispered. “More accurately, *I* can’t. Distilling magic into a liquid form is advanced alchemy, but it is possible. However, I have never seen a cloak like Gretchen’s before. I do not know how it was made, whether its fabricators used pure magic or alchemy and, in the case of the former option, what rituals or incantations were used in its construction, whether the material matters, and so on and so forth, is unknown to me. It might be possible to discern some of that through deconstruction, but I wouldn’t want to damage such a useful artifact.”

Arkk pursed his lips in annoyance. There went another plan. Admittedly, it was a plan he had only thought of since meeting Gretchen and Morford. Simply being able to waltz into the Duke’s compound unseen by all would have been a perfect way to hire Alya and then teleport her to that nearby fortress expansion that didn’t exist yet.

“I don’t suppose you would be willing to sell the cloak?” Arkk asked, looking over to Gretchen.

Her eyes narrowed further. “It is the only thing keeping me safe from the likes of… *them*.”

Arkk just sighed, wrapping the treatise back in its protective leathers. “I hope you enjoy living under it for the rest of your life.”

“Better living under it than dead.”

Conceding the point with a slight nod of his head, Arkk headed toward the door. “Dakka, we’re leaving at first light. No heavy drinking tonight.”

“I can sleep in the—”

“Dakka.”

The orc crossed her arms with a snort. “You’re the boss.”

“Morford. Gretchen. I won’t tell anyone where you are, but…” Arkk shrugged as he stepped out the door. “Good luck.”

With that, he started walking down the road. A whistle from Dakka called Orjja and Farr’an.

“So,” Dakka started as they neared the stayover. “All that for nothing?”

“Maybe. I’m hoping the alchemist remembers your comment about taking them to the fortress and asks to either shelter Gretchen or both of them.”

“I thought you didn’t want to drag them away from their lives here.”

“I don’t. I’m not a kidnapper,” Arkk said, mildly offended. “But if they want to come willingly, that is a different story. Regardless of their decisions, I can’t justify spending more time here trying to convince them. There will be other ways to reach Alya.”

He just had to figure out what those ways were.

## 27 - Storm Delay


“We’re not leaving in *that* are we?”

A flash of lightning illuminated three orcs and a human as they looked out the door of the Darkwood stayover. The low rumbles of the following thunder didn’t manage to overpower the heavy patter of pouring rain.

“I said we would leave at first daylight,” Arkk said with a heavy frown, leading to the orcs grumbling under their breath. Arkk shook his head. Unfortunately, he agreed with them. “It doesn’t look like we’re getting daylight today.”

The light drizzle from the day prior had turned into a full-blown storm overnight. There wasn’t much wind, but the rain and lightning made up for it in droves. Even if he was willing to brave the lightning on the open road, they wouldn’t have gotten far before their cart wheels wound up stuck in the mud.

Closing the door, Arkk looked back to the stayover’s tavern area. His group wasn’t the only one present. Two of the First Legion, one he had hit with a bolt of lightning and one of the ones who had been outside during that confrontation, were glaring in his direction. The Order of the Claymores had two seated with them, both glaring as well even though Arkk had done nothing to either.

Looking around, Arkk’s frown only deepened. With the storm, it looked like everyone who could get away with it was staying inside. There were two other tables with a mixture of bounty hunter organizations. Both tables were glaring in his direction as well, though not to quite the same intensity as the First Legion. It did make him wonder what kind of rumors had flown about the tavern since the day before.

“Try not to start anything, but I guess we’ve got the day off,” Arkk whispered before heading over to the counter. The stayover proprietor had a large pot of soup being kept warm over some embers. He overpaid for a bowl and then headed to the one occupied table that *wasn’t* glaring daggers at him.

“Mind if I sit here?” Arkk said.

This table only had two others seated. A middle-aged man with graying hair and a younger woman who might have been his daughter with vibrant brown, almost orange hair. Arkk, however, was more interested in their clothes at the moment. The man wore a fine green vest held together with polished wooden toggles. The woman had a black dress with fur trim and a deep blue sleeveless jacket worn open.

Not the sort of clothes peasants or even mercenaries wore around often.

As long as he was trapped here, he might as well try to learn something.

“Arkk,” Arkk said, introducing himself as the older man nodded his agreement to Arkk’s request. “Leader of Company Al-Mir.”

“A free company?”

Arkk nodded his head. “More or less.” Mostly less. Free companies were typically mercenaries hired for war and little else. There wasn’t currently a war going on anywhere around the Duchy of Mystakeen and Arkk had no intentions of getting involved in one should one start.

“Aron Wolf,” he said, extending a hand. “Wolf Trading Company. My daughter, Arianna Wolf.”

“Charmed,” Arkk said, only to be met with rolling eyes. Paying Arianna little mind, Arkk turned his attention back to Aron. “You’re merchants? Trading in the ebon wood, I presume.”

“Merchants?” Aron said with a chuckle. “That’s a bit small for what we do, but not inaccurate, I suppose. And yes. Ebony wood is in quite high demand across the great states and even beyond the kingdom’s borders. I just purchased the local lumber mill and plan on expanding it to double its output.”

Arkk nodded along, slowly eating his soup as he listened to the merchant discuss all his plans for the area. Aron had a lot to say on the subject. Enough so that Arkk imagined he took great enjoyment from both the financial and logistical side of his business but never got a chance to discuss such things with others. In truth, Arkk wasn’t at all interested in wood trade. Not even if it was rare and fancy wood. Still, he politely nodded along until he found an opportunity to ask a question of much higher interest.

“Have you ever been to Cliff?”

“Oh of course,” Aron said with an easy smile before lightly patting his daughter’s back. “We have a home there, though the servants seem to live there more than we do these days. We’re planning on building here this coming year as well, though in truth, we spend most of our time traveling between the larger cities.”

“You travel yourself? For the trade? I figured you hire people to do that for you.”

Aron hesitated but nodded his head. “That is true. I have some people working for me. But I always like to meet with my clients personally. If you want something done right, do it yourself! That’s what my father always said,” he added with a laugh.

Arkk wasn’t sure if it was the laugh or what he said, but Arianna shot her father a withering look before slowly shaking her head. “You won’t be able to keep that up, Father,” she said, tone clipped. “Especially with this latest expansion.”

“And that is why you’re here learning,” Aron said with a full smile. “I can’t think of anyone better suited to represent Wolf Trading Company than a Wolf.”

Watching her flat look, Arkk asked, “Not interested in the family business?”

“Not by half.”

“Nonsense!” Aron rubbed his daughter’s shoulder. “You’ve a sharp mind, my dear. When I turn the company over to you, I know you’ll take it to new heights!”

“Because I know how to delegate,” she said, arms crossed in a huff. “If we weren’t traveling constantly, we could get so much more done. *And* we would have time to relax and socialize among other elites, people who would bring in more money when they buy our wares.”

“Mister Arkk is the leader of a free company and he is traveling,” Aron said, turning fully toward his daughter. “He understands the importance of a personal touch.”

“A free company carries out vastly different tasks than a trading company,” Arianna said, voice firm. “Not to mention, *Mister* Arkk must certainly understand the importance of delegation. You do have more than three orcs under your command, do you not?”

“That is true,” Arkk said. “Al-Mir is undertaking several different tasks at the moment. Magical research, exploration, mercenary jobs, recruitment, and others.” Saying it like that made it sound far more grandiose than a few people running around without a clue what they were doing.

“You must be here because this is either a job of great import, it is something you don’t trust underlings to handle, or it is something that only you can accomplish. Correct?”

Arkk decided to nod his head in agreement, more to see where she was going with this than because she was entirely accurate. Finding Gretchen was something others *could* have done and he even trusted them to do so, it was just that everyone he did trust to do this was busy with other things. Vezta was working on the portal, Olatt’an and Ilya were heading toward her home, and Rekk’ar had to remain with the other orcs at the fortress. Technically, he could have sent Dakka on her own…

He probably would have wound up with Gretchen dragged back to the fortress against her will. As much as he didn’t want to do that himself, a traitorous corner of his mind thought it might have been the preferable outcome. He still doubted he would have turned her over to her father but access to that invisibility cloak might have been worth making an enemy of some viscount’s daughter.

Unfortunately, he didn’t get to see where Arianna was headed with her train of thought.

The door to the stayover flung open, letting chill, moist air into the warm tavern. Standing in the doorway, the alchemist’s beaked mask slowly turned from one side of the room to the other. As soon as the dark lenses of their mask stopped on Arkk, Morford began moving with haste.

Arkk had to admire the alchemist’s cloak. It wasn’t that thick, but the rainwater just rolled off it. As soon as they took their first step into the tavern, it was like they had never been in the rain at all. Their cloak was as dry as if it had been hung in front of a fire for hours.

“I would speak with you,” the alchemist whispered upon reaching the table.

“You’re late. I said daybreak.”

“That’s not…” The alchemist clenched their fist, holding out a small scrap of parchment.

Raising an eyebrow, Arkk took it and quickly skimmed the few short sentences. “She’s gone?”

“Didn’t want to cause me further disturbance,” the alchemist whispered, referencing a line in the scribbled note. “When I woke this morning, she was gone.”

“I’m not sure what you want me to do about this. I already said I wasn’t going to force her to do anything if she didn’t want to.”

“You must find her. I… I cannot match the viscount’s price, but I can pay.” Arkk tried to get a word in, but the alchemist held up a hand. Although their voice still came out in a whisper, the intensity behind it spoke of their fear. “She cannot be out *today*. The storm… Days like these are the most dangerous around Darkwood. The times of year when the walls are put to the test. If she has left the burg, she will be torn to pieces at *best*.”

“Even with the cloak?”

“The inability to see will not affect creatures that hunt by sound and smell.”

“It certainly affects my ability to find her,” Arkk said as his hand drifted toward the crystal ball hanging from his waist. “I know a tracking ritual. If she hasn’t gotten far, it might work—I’m not sure how it would interact with the invisibility cloak. I suppose it is worth a shot. I need a part of her. Hair, blood, maybe a few threads from the clothing she is wearing. Anything like that will work.”

The beaked mask dipped as the alchemist sagged in relief. “I will scour my home. There must be something left behind.”

“Hurry. I don’t know exactly how far the tracking ritual can reach, only that it has limits. If she is beyond those limits, finding her will be nearly impossible. We’ll meet you at your workshop.” It was about halfway between the stayover and the alchemist’s house.

“I will be there.”

“As for pay,” Arkk started before the alchemist could run. They stiffened, freezing as the dark lenses of their mask locked onto Arkk. “Treat some of our gear with that soakless solution and we’ll call it even.”

“That’s it? That is worth a few dozen silvers at best.”

“Are you really arguing?”

The alchemist stared for a moment more before turning without a word. They didn’t quite walk straight as they moved to the door, moving with a limp in their gait. Arkk watched until the door slammed behind them before he stood and looked back to the two who he had shared a table with.

“Did I understand that correctly?” Arianna said, staring with wide eyes. “Some foolish girl ran off into the storm? Around Darkwood? Even we have heard the rumors…”

“It seems work is calling,” was all Arkk said, offering a wan smile. “I’d love to chat more, but don’t know if we’ll run into each other again here. Will you be back in Cliff anytime soon?”

Arianna and Aron simply stared until the former clacked her jaw together.

“There are monsters—*ghasts* among other things—out in the forest.”

“Do you have a death wish?” Arianna added to her father’s statement.

“As you said, a free company has remarkably different duties compared to a trading company.”

“In exchange for *soakless solution*?”

“Company Al-Mir is excessively wealthy. Besides, who said I am doing this for nothing?” Arkk grinned. “What I hope to get out of this little job is worth far more than anything that alchemist could come up with. It isn’t always about coin.”

Aron shuddered, but stood up, extending a hand once again. “Well said, my boy. Well said indeed. Saving a poor lost girl is a noble cause.” He gave Arkk a far firmer grip on his handshake this time around. “If you do make it back to Cliff, the House of Wolf would be honored to see you as a guest. Our manor is in the trade district. Large wolf emblem on the gates. Can’t miss it. If we aren’t there, I’ll instruct the servants to admit you so you might leave a missive. I would be most interested in hearing how this turns out.”

“I’ll be happy to tell you. Good day,” Arkk said as he turned to the rest of the room.

Most of the room had eyes on him once again. They had probably been staring since the alchemist arrived. Arkk paid them little mind, looking to his employees. They had eyes on him as well.

“Time to go,” Arkk said.

“Into the storm?” Orjja grumbled. “Thought we had the day off.”

Dakka punched Orjja in the shoulder as she stood, shooting the other orc a glare. “Boss said it's time to go. It is time to go,” she said, then leaned down to whisper something into Orjja’s ear.

Arkk didn’t catch what was said, but he did catch the way Orjja’s skin changed to a sickly shade of green. He hadn’t thought that was possible. Whatever Dakka said, it got Orjja practically sprinting to the door. Farr’an didn’t need any extra encouragement. He simply downed the rest of his bowl of soup before following Orjja out.

“Good luck,” Arianna said just as Arkk reached the door behind Dakka. He smiled even as she turned aside and added, “Idiot.”

“What’d you say to Orjja?” Arkk asked as he stepped out into the pouring rain.

He hated everything about accepting the job the moment he felt the water soak into his cloak. It took consoling himself with the promise of the alchemist’s soakless solution to continue walking.

Dakka didn’t seem to mind, though the rain was making the dark paint under her eyes start to run down her cheeks. “Just reminded her what happens to people who displease you.”

“What happens to people who displease me?” Arkk asked, genuinely curious as to the answer.

“They get hung outside burgs as a warning to others. Or experimented upon with new magic.”

Arkk shot her a dark look. “I would appreciate it if you didn’t threaten my employees with death. Unless they’re trying to summon demons or run off to raid villages, I’m not going to kill her. Or any of you.”

Dakka didn’t seem bothered in the slightest. “It got her moving.”

“I don’t want you all *afraid* of me.”

“*I’m* not. I doubt Rekk’ar or the Ripthroat are either. Those who you recused from the prison room probably aren’t too afraid. The rest?”

Orjja had been one of two that Dakka had wanted to convince to change sides and the only one of those two who had survived that particular skirmish. Arkk wasn’t sure how early she had surrendered, but Dakka was probably counting her among ‘the rest’ for this.

“Just… Dakka, as my field commander, try not to traumatize them. That gives them more reason to desert or rebel.”

“I’m afraid I’ll have to reject that order.”

“What? Wh—”

“We were in a crowded tavern. You do not want your employees disrespecting you or fighting against you in public. It undermines your authority, makes you look weak, and instills more thoughts of rebellion than a good threat would. Orcs don’t respect that. If someone is talking back, you should just punch them.” Dakka looked down, eyes roving over Arkk’s arms. “Or hit them with a lightning bolt.”

Arkk took in a breath and let it back out slowly. She… had a point there. Although… “Are we including *you* in that, Miss Reject-that-order?”

Dakka stiffened, lips pressed together as much as orc anatomy would allow, hiding most of her tusks. “Uh… no, Sir. Not me, Sir.”

“Relax. I’m not going to punish you for explaining yourself,” Arkk said maybe a little too quickly, but he didn’t want her to regress to the stiff Dakka that had been with him and Ilya on the first day of their journey to Cliff. “You know orcs better than I do. I’ll leave them to you to handle. Just try to keep the threats, direct or implied, to a minimum.”

“Very good, Sir.”

Arkk let out a small groan, one muffled by a roll of thunder. Deciding to let the matter drop for the moment, he kept silent until they reached the alchemist’s workshop. The door was locked but the roof hung a bit over the door, letting them keep mostly out of the rain.

It wasn’t long before the alchemist came limping back with a crystal phial in hand. Within, he had a single curly white hair.

Arkk and the orcs handed over their cloaks for treatment. While the alchemist shoved them into a large cauldron and began pouring liquids inside, Arkk took a stick of chalk and started sketching out the tracking ritual.

An unpleasant tightness formed in his stomach as he looked over the lines. He hadn’t used the ritual even once since using it to kill the orc’s former chieftain. Even now, he wasn’t sure he wanted to use it. If he pushed a bit too much magic into the ritual, Gretchen might not have a *chance* to be torn apart by the monsters of Darkwood.

Knowing she probably would be torn apart if he *didn’t* perform the ritual, Arkk took a breath and stepped into the circle.

He pushed minuscule amounts of magic into it, slowly and carefully building it up until he felt the ritual complete. The hair in the triangular section of the circle began glowing with that ethereal translucency that he knew could be seen through walls.

Slowly, Arkk turned in place until he spotted a much larger mass in the distance beyond the alchemy workshop.

“Got her,” Arkk said.

## 28 - Monsters in the Woods


Arkk was no stranger to being out in the middle of a storm. Really bad storms didn’t happen around Langleey more than a few times a year. When they did occur, they tended to do so at unpredictable moments. If he was in the village, it was typically a time for staying indoors and doing little else. Sometimes, however, they happened while he and Ilya were out hunting, forcing them to seek shelter—and often forcing them to head home should the winds have ripped their camp down.

This storm was the first Arkk could recall in which he ventured out into it willingly.

The soakless solution on the cloaks helped a lot. The rain didn’t quite *avoid* them, but it was the next closest thing. If not for the humidity in the air, he wouldn’t have felt much different than on a chill day. Watching the water run down his front without drenching him brought a little spark of joy as he started thinking back to that treatise on alchemy, wondering if he would be able to make something like this in the future. If Arkk had known this was possible, he would have tried to find an alchemist a long time ago to treat his clothes.

Though, until recently, he wouldn’t have been able to afford it.

Checking over his shoulder, he was pleased to note that all three of his orcs were looking much happier, outfitted in their own cloaks. Morford walked a short distance away, moving with their group without being a complete part of it.

Turning his attention forward again, Arkk frowned. “Damn. She must have been beyond the walls before I started tracking her.”

The street they just stepped on was near the edge of Darkwood Burg. A thick stone wall stood tall at the end of the street, blocking progress forward. While Arkk could see the ethereal glow of Gretchen in the distance, he hadn’t been able to tell what was between them. This had simply been the most direct path from the alchemist’s shop to Gretchen.

“Is there a gate nearby?” Arkk asked, looking to Morford.

The alchemist looked around as if to double-check where they were, then nodded. “Follow me,” they whispered before walking along the street they had just come from.

The nearest gate took longer to reach than Arkk had been hoping for. He knew from the first time he had successfully performed the tracking ritual that it wouldn’t last forever. He didn’t know exactly how long that was, but if it started to fade before they reached Gretchen, he would do nothing to try to restart it. He couldn’t risk that.

Not with what happened to the stag.

The gate was locked tight, protected by miserable guards trying to take cover from the rain in the small alcoves on either side of the larger wooden structure. A few happier guards hung out near the guardhouse, safe under its awnings. As miserable as the others looked, the ones positioned on the ramparts had to be in a worse state of mind, not even having a wall to block some of the rain. The alchemist, in far more of a hurry than Arkk was even with the time limitations on his ritual, rushed up and began speaking with one of the guards. Their conversation concluded before Arkk could finish walking up.

“They will allow us out,” Morford whispered as the guard pulled the latches on the smaller door set within the larger gate.

“I know what I said back in the tavern about following your orders… We’re really going out in this?” Dakka grumbled, first glancing at the dark clouds overhead and then at Arkk.

He wasn’t particularly happy about it either. Perhaps he should have taken everything the alchemist owned instead of just the soakless solution.

Dakka’s shield was on her back, over her cloak. As she ducked through the relatively small door, she drew her axe, holding it firm in two hands. The other orcs followed suit, drawing their weapons. Orjja wielded a large mace with thick triangular protrusions coming off the bulbous end. Farr’an, apparently having taken up tutelage under Olatt’an, wielded a crossbow with a nasty blade on the end.

Arkk had his daggers but planned to use lightning almost exclusively if something started a fight.

The alchemist followed up in the rear, brandishing no obvious weapons but took a moment to adjust a number of vials on a bandolier. Some contained colored liquid, others clear liquid, and others still looked more like they contained miniature clouds. Arkk was curious, but not so much so that he hoped one of the Darkwood’s monsters would come charging out and force the alchemist to reveal just what was in those stoppered bottles.

Outside the burg, thankfully on the side of the town that faced away from the majority of the forest even if some of it did wrap around and follow alongside the road, Arkk could see the ethereal glow of Gretchen in the distance. It didn’t look like she was making good time, trudging away with heavy steps. From her posture, hazy though it was to his eyes, he guessed that she was wrapped up tight in her cloak.

It hadn’t occurred to Arkk to try to scry on her as scrying on someone invisible was fairly useless. Now, he wondered if that cloak was her invisibility cloak or a regular one that she had switched to for the travel.

Drawing his crystal ball from its pouch, he looked down and focused. Unable to tell how far away to look from the tracking spell alone, he focused on himself first then dragged the view in the crystal ball toward Gretchen’s position. After a few moments of seeing nothing, Arkk almost put the crystal ball away. Movement in its smooth surface made him pause. A few quick flashes of the view changing had him close enough to see what they might be dealing with.

“Wolves,” he said, drawing the attention of the others even as they hurried along the path away from Darkwood Burg.

A small pack. Six that he could see. All things considered, a pack of wolves wasn’t the worst thing to face. Even better, while in the rough direction of Gretchen, they didn’t seem to be actively hunting her. The heavy rain probably played havoc on their senses, drowning out footsteps and washing away smells in the air. Still, they were in her direction and that alone posed a mild danger. Most wolves wouldn’t just maul a person for no reason, but if they were hungry enough?

Arkk had everyone pick up the pace.

A few wolves weren’t a problem. So long as they were far enough away from him when he spotted them, he could likely take them out on his own. Having seen the results of the orcs on their first mercenary job, that of culling a few out-of-control wolves that had been harassing a village, he was willing to bet that Dakka alone could take them on, let alone all three orcs and him. That was assuming the wolves would fight at all rather than run off once faced with a threat they couldn’t handle. Arkk figured that just them showing up would see them back to the woods.

With them running and Gretchen stumbling through the mud, they made decent progress relative to her. It was quite a ways away, far enough that Darkwood Burg looked like a little brown box against the backdrop of the thick Darkwoods. Had Gretchen managed to get her hands on a horse, catching up would have been a much more difficult ordeal. As it was, it just took some good old-fashioned hustle.

In the distance, he thought he could see her. The actual Gretchen, not the ethereal tracking spell. The crystal ball must have been too small to see properly, but there was an odd haze in the air. A person-shaped bubble where the rainwater hit and ran off, leaving a space in the air. As impressive as the invisibility cloak was, it did not work perfectly in the rain.

He could see the wolves as well, lurking off in the woods a short distance away from the path. As Arkk expected, their hasty approach startled the small pack, sending them away.

“Gretchen!” the alchemist said, apparently having seen the same distortion in the air that Arkk had. Their voice was still a whisper, but a raised one filled with a harsh rasp.

The haze, and the ethereal glow coming from within, froze.

“She knows we can see her, right?” Dakka said, loud enough that it was meant for Gretchen to hear.

There was a long pause before Gretchen reached up and pulled her hood down. “I told you not to follow me,” she said, looking about ready to cry. Maybe she was crying. With the rain, it was hard to tell.

“I *might* have listened to your wishes had you left on any other day.” Morford stepped forward, only for Gretchen to step back. The alchemist stopped moving as soon as she did so. “Today? What were you thinking? You know the dangers—”

Six heads snapped to the south of the road as a baying cry started and silenced in the same short second. An instant later, four of the wolves from earlier bolted out from the tree line straight toward their group. The lightning spell on Arkk’s tongue died as he watched the four wolves, two of whom were splattered with blood, run straight past them, heading into one of the recently emptied fields.

A new noise followed in the wake of the wolves, drawing everyone’s attention back to the trees. Arkk had a hard time identifying just what that noise was supposed to be. A howl? A shout? Laughter? It sounded distinctly human and yet animalistic at the same time.

Whatever it was, it sent a chill up his spine.

“We cannot be out here,” the alchemist whispered, grasping hold of Gretchen’s invisible shoulders. “Back to the burg. Quickly.”

“And put our back to that sound?” Arkk asked, watching as Morford forced a protesting Gretchen along the road.

“Better to be near the wall than caught in the open.”

“Caught by *what*?” Dakka asked, glowering at the trees.

“Ghasts,” the alchemist said. “Quickly.”

None of them made it more than five steps before that chittering howl started again. It was louder now. Closer. Arkk narrowed his eyes, looking at the trees. With the heavy clouds overhead diminishing what little light made it through the trees and the rain making it even harder to see, he didn’t spot the source of the sound.

“What is a ghast?” Arkk asked, moving once again. Even Gretchen wasn’t protesting now.

“Beasts created for war,” Morford whispered without looking back. “We do not wish to encounter even a single one.”

“Created?”

This time, the alchemist’s beak-like mask turned. Not fully. They still kept their hands on Gretchen’s shoulders as they rushed along the path. “This forest has played home to a plethora of unpleasant guests over its lifetime. Necromancers, warlocks, vampires, and others besides. This dark forest contains numerous ancient evils.

“The ghasts are creations of a life alchemist attempting to design a being that could conquer the kingdom. I dare say he might have succeeded if he hadn’t been consumed by his creations before he could learn to control them. It is what initially drew my interest to this area.”

“You wanted to conquer the kingdom?”

“I wanted knowledge. What would I do with a kingdom?” The alchemist managed to inject incredulity into their whisper.

Shaking his head, Arkk looked to the forest again and decided to ask a slightly more immediately important question. “Are they immune to lightning?”

“I do not know. They were created for war and all that entails.”

Although Arkk talked to every single person who passed through Langleey Village, learning more about the world beyond the farms, he had little clue about what, exactly, war entailed. Obviously, people fighting each other. Soldiers, weapons, knights, and spellcasters. Zullie had taught him the academy-approved lightning spell and it was fairly long-winded, but if a row of spellcasters was protected by a frontline of soldiers, they would be able to cast it with relative freedom.

But *did* they? Would a man who wanted to conquer the kingdom have prepared his creations for lightning spells in specific?

Arkk gnawed at his lip as another cackling howl echoed from the trees.

This time, he saw something. A dark shape, shadowed by the heavy birch and pine trees. The silhouette shuddered with great, heaving breaths as it stood hunched over with long harms dangling down to its legs. Arkk opened his mouth, the incantation for lightning on his lips, but the creature disappeared behind another copse of trees before he could get a single syllable out.

“It is watching us,” he said instead.

“All the more reason to hurry,” Morford said, drawing a vial of dark red liquid and holding it tight in one hand.

“If we reach the walls and they don’t let us in because we’re being chased, doesn’t that just mean that we’ll be up *against* that wall with nowhere to run?”

“You would rather face it out here?”

“I would rather not face it at all if I’m being honest. How likely is it to attack us? Do they travel in packs?”

“There won’t be more. They are aggressively territorial toward their own kind,” Morford whispered, looking off into the trees. “Another failure by their creator. As for how likely it is to attack? I’m surprised it isn’t attacking already.”

Arkk started to ask another question, only to freeze as he caught sight of the creature once again. It chittered, wheezing behind one of the trees. He could see it better now. Closer to leaving the forest, it was in the light enough for Arkk to grimace in revulsion. Hairless with skin a ghastly gray, it looked like a human with distorted proportions. Its eyes were tiny relative to its head and it lacked both a nose and ears, having only thin slits in their places. It lacked lips as well, leaving gums and far too many teeth visible as the skin was drawn back around its maw. Red glistened off its teeth.

Blood from one of the wolves?

It elicited a feeling of revulsion similar to what he had experienced the first time he saw one of the lesser servants. It wasn’t quite the same but it was a feeling of wrongness. The creature near the trees just *shouldn’t* be.

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk intoned.

Even as he built up magic at the tips of his fingers, he didn’t fire the spell.

The eyes of the monster changed. Formerly a beady white, the moment Arkk finished his incantation, they glowed a luminous red. A familiar red. Its entire posture shifted, moving from a hunched back to a straightened back. The laughing wheeze vanished.

Arkk’s eyes widened, then narrowed immediately. Not sure that he could do it on demand, he drew on as much irritation as he could manage; the rain, the waste of time this trip had been, the delay in returning to the fortress, and the other bounty hunters. All his feelings focused on a point.

An external view of himself using his connection to his employees showed his eyes flashing red. It didn’t last long. A few seconds at most.

It was enough.

The ghast, the *possessed* ghast, stilled for a long moment. Its large thighs and digitigrade legs made it look like it was better suited for leaping, yet it took a single step forward.

Farr’an readied his crossbow and the alchemist raised the vial in his hand, ready to throw.

“Wait!” Arkk said, holding up a hand. Aside from that single step, the ghast wasn’t moving. Just watching.

“Wait?” Morford hissed. “I’ve seen the red-eyed ones before. They’re smarter and far more vicious.”

“Orjja, Farr’an, escort Gretchen and Morford back to town. Dakka, with me.”

*Everyone* hesitated at Arkk’s orders. He could see Dakka’s glance at him over his shoulder.

“You sure about that, boss?”

“No. But…” Arkk took a breath, not blinking as he kept his eyes on the monster. It still wasn’t moving toward them, just watching and waiting. “But yes. Do it.”

Orjja and Farr’an still hesitated. Morford and Gretchen did not. Jerking his head got the orcs moving. Arkk waited a few moments for them to put some distance between them before he cautiously approached the line of trees. Arkk eyed the monster’s teeth and its long fingers. The fingers were like spider legs, sharp and to a point with thick joints. One of its hands was as red as its face.

But it still didn’t attack.

Arkk kept a distance between them. He might be curious and suspecting that this wasn’t some wild creature, but he wasn’t a *complete* idiot. Only mostly an idiot.

“Do you speak?” Arkk said, then paused and altered his question. “Maybe I should ask if this *body* speaks?”

The ghast narrowed its thin eyes even further. When it did speak, its voice gurgled with a wet slop in the back of its throat. “You are the one casting old magic in my domain.” Arkk got a distinct impression that these creatures were not designed to speak as humans did. Or, if they had been designed to speak, this one hadn’t done so in years. Its speech was further hampered by its lack of lips.

“If by old magic you mean a single lightning bolt yesterday, then yes. Otherwise, I have no idea what you are talking about.”

A repetitive clicking came from the back of the ghast’s throat. Arkk wasn’t sure what that meant.

He was curious and wary. The presence of this possessor made Arkk wonder about this forest. All the stories he had been told, from what Hawkwood said back in Cliff to the alchemist just a few moments ago, said that this forest harbored numerous dangerous creatures. It drew the attention of necromancers and life alchemists—whatever those were—and other powerful individuals who all sought refuge within to carry out their plots and research.

Now it was starting to make a little more sense. There was a [HEART] in the forest. One that sounded like it had been claimed many times over the decades.

Was there another of Vezta’s kind out in the forest? Did this claimant know more old magic than Arkk did? Was there a library out there filled with a treasure trove of old books that were more intact than those in Arkk’s library? Would this [HEART] work for Vezta’s ultimate goal or would they have to destroy it?

He was curious. Eager, even. Yet, something gnawed at the back of his mind. It had been gnawing since seeing this creature’s eyes turn red. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what that feeling was, only that it was screaming a single word at him.

*Rival*.

“Where did you learn?” the gurgling gaunt asked.

“Old magic?” Arkk licked his lips. “A mentor taught me everything she knew. You? You’re using *Cranium Internum*, correct? Possession.”

Its narrow eyes widened for a moment. “You *do* know. In my eighty years, I have never met another…”

Arkk did not miss how it didn’t answer his question. He didn’t bring it up. Most of that was an attempt at deflection. Admitting to being another owner of a [HEART] felt dangerous. He would consult with Vezta before saying anything on the subject. Instead, he shrugged. “I am a traveler from afar after a bounty. I wasn’t expecting to meet someone like you. I apologize if you feel I’ve intruded. We were going to leave today, but the storm has delayed us.”

“After feeling the old magic, I set my watchers along the roads. I was preparing to invade the burg, but I suppose that is no longer necessary.”

“Invade?” Arkk said, tension threatening to rip his stomach apart. “Just for me? For a single lightning spell?”

He had been about to ask if the ghast—or the person possessing it—would be willing to sell books on old magic in exchange for gold. Now?

“An old magic practitioner is too rare. I would have you give your knowledge to me.”

“I have a few books,” Arkk said. “Not with me, but—”

“No books,” the ghast said, stepping forward. “I would have you give your knowledge to me.”

Something about the way it spoke made Arkk think that it wasn’t inviting him to a nice sit-down around a cup of tea for a chat about their favorite spells. The way it was looking at him was more akin to something wanting to rip open his mind and consume the contents without any regard for him.

Was that possible to do with possession? Arkk hadn’t tried to do anything similar during his one experiment with the spell, but it did make a little sense. He had been sharing Zullie’s mind.

Something to think about later.

For now…

“Well,” he started, trying to keep as calm as possible. “I suppose I could share my favorite spell right now. Have you heard of… *Electro Deus*.”

The moment the incantation left his lips, Arkk opened the gateway of his magical power to its fullest. Every scrap of magic he had went into his fingers as he thrust his hand forward. A bolt of lightning burned into his eyes as a deafening thunderclap threatened to throw him to the ground. The air around him lost all moisture as it burned, feeling more like he was standing next to a bonfire rather than out in a rainstorm.

When his eyes finally cleared, the ghast was gone. In a panic, he started looking around, only to turn back to where the ghast had been.

There was a dark cloud there. Shadow given a misty form. As it slowly solidified, a pair of bright red lights appeared in the *head* of the shadow. The two eyes narrowed into thin slits, forming a glare that lacked any words but promised pain, agony, and ultimate death.

Before Arkk could start the incantation over for a fresh if less powerful bolt of lightning, the shadow whisked away through the trees.

Gone.

Possessing something else? Another ghast? Back to his [HEART]? Arkk didn’t know.

All he did know was that they needed to get out of here. Immediately. Back to the burg, maybe to mount a defense against whatever invasion that Keeper of a Heart had been planning on.

Turning, he noted Dakka’s face twisted in a snarl. She was blinking several times, trying to clear her own eyes from that bright lightning bolt. At the same time, she looked completely ready to chop her axe down through whatever approached.

“Are you okay?”

“Where did it go?” she growled. “Did you get it?”

“I think I got the ghast. Not whatever was possessing it.” Arkk, carefully, grabbed Dakka’s arm and helped lead her back to the road.

Shaking him off, she kept blinking for a few moments before shaking her head. “I’m fine. Just a blind spot straight through the center of my eyes.”

“Sorry. After the alchemist’s comments, I wasn’t sure that a normal lightning bolt would put it down.”

“I wish I could have seen its face,” she grumbled. “Didn’t know who it was messing with, did it?”

“We need to get back and try to convince the guard that a threat is coming,” Arkk said, avoiding her question. It wasn’t like he had given it a fair shot. The ghast probably would have torn him apart if he hadn’t taken it by surprise. If it came back with two ghasts, he doubted he would be able to kill both before they reached him. Not with that powerful of a bolt of lightning, anyway.

Shaking his head, he started running down the path toward the other orcs and humans. He could see they had stopped. Probably because of that thunder. “We need to hurry,” Arkk shouted. “We’ll pick up and carry Morford and Gretchen if we have to.”

Hopefully, the guards could be readied for an invasion.

## 29 - Reinforcements


“*Slave Natum*.”

A trio of lesser servants appeared before Arkk. “Search the forest,” Arkk said. “Look for a fortress like Al-Mir. Failing that, alert me if you find anything that looks like a permanent dwelling.” They hadn’t even finished forming before they burrowed into the ground heading in the direction of the Darkwood forest, moving to carry out his commands. He wasn’t sure that they needed verbal orders. Around Fortress Al-Mir, they always just seemed to know what was needed at any given moment.

The verbal command at least removed any ambiguity on his end.

Ignoring the repulsed noises and cries of alarm from both his companions and the wall guards, Arkk closed his eyes and focused his attention afar.

Within Fortress Al-Mir, Arkk ripped one of the lesser servants through space remotely. It couldn’t reach him—he was far too far away—but he could pick it up and drop it down right in front of Vezta, stopping a discussion between her and Zullie. Assisting him from afar might not be possible. He still felt that she should be aware of the situation.

If it came down to it, Vezta had suggested chaining together teleportation rituals for rapid transit in the past. Both of them had been leery of actually doing so for the simple reason that it would leave a trail that led directly back to the fortress. Destroying the circles forced the one doing the destroying to walk the distance, which wasn’t an insurmountable problem but it was an irritating one.

With the lesser servant interrupting Vezta, a crystal ball appearing in its hand along with an alembic, he hoped Vezta would catch on. She was smart enough.

As soon as Arkk saw her pick up the crystal ball and start scrying with it, Arkk opened his eyes. It would likely take her a few minutes to find him since he wasn’t actually in the alchemist’s workshop, the first place he figured she would check because of that alembic. That gave him plenty of time to start scrawling down a few messages for Vezta to read from afar. The guards, after receiving a generous donation of far too many coins, had been more than happy to lend him some parchment and ink.

“I will be getting Gretchen back to my workshop,” Morford whispered. Gretchen was under the cloak once again, but Morford had a hand gripping the empty air, so presumably, he was holding onto her.

They started to turn, but Arkk held up a hand. “Wait.”

Morford stiffened. “I offered payment. I can offer more if—”

“I don’t care about payment or Gretchen at the moment. You said you had seen red-eyed ghasts before? When? Under what circumstances? Have you ever seen more than one at a time? How many ghasts are estimated to be in the forest?”

Arkk could feel the flat look he was getting despite not being able to see it. “Gretchen—”

“Is an excuse. Answer my questions, alchemist.” Arkk shot a look at Dakka and nodded his head toward Morford. “This is not negotiable. If you refuse, I will carry out the job I initially came here for. Rescuing Gretchen from her captor.” Arkk shot a pointed look at Morford as he said that.

“You *wouldn’t*,” hissed the empty air next to the alchemist as Dakka approached, arms crossed over her chest.

“I won’t need to if you just answer the questions.”

“An invasion of ghasts is unlikely at worst,” Morford hedged, sounding more resigned than upset. “They don’t work together.”

“Assume there is an outside force making them work together.”

“That is just as absurd. I have studied the creatures in an attempt to uncover the secrets of their creation. They possess a gland that secretes a substance which makes them angry and then turns their rage into strength and brutality. Unfortunately, a flaw in its design causes it to go overactive when in the presence of another of their kind. The smell of each other sets it off. Hence their territoriality.”

“Boss,” Dakka said, “we might be dealing with more than just ghasts.”

“How do you figure?”

Dakka shrugged. “You hired us, that witch, and Vezta, right? There are all kinds of monsters out in this forest. If this guy can hire these ghast things, who is to say that he can’t hire everything else?”

Arkk closed his eyes. She was right. He hadn’t actually hired Vezta—she had come along as a part of the fortress more than a minion—but everything else was accurate. What all was out in the forest? Undead, an insect colony, goblins, raptors… probably more besides those. Raptors were beasts more than monsters. Was it possible to hire them? If not, it was entirely possible that he would have people in his employ capable of taming them and using them as war beasts.

Pulling out his crystal ball, Arkk asked, “Morford, when you were out there exploring, did you ever come across old ruins, structures, landmarks, peculiar activity among the various monsters, or anything else of interest?”

The guards, though happy to hand over parchment in exchange for gold, hadn’t believed a word about an *invasion*. Monsters threw themselves against the walls of Darkwood Burg with a regularity that had become routine. None of those assaults were organized. If he could scry an army approaching and show it off, he might be able to organize a proper defense.

While Morford thought, Arkk quickly checked in on Vezta. She and Zullie were hovering over the crystal ball. A quick glimpse into their crystal ball showed it focused on him. Glad Vezta was such an adept at scrying, Arkk pointed over to the parchment where he had set it down on the gatehouse table. One of the guards was reading it as well, not that Arkk minded much. While he hadn’t written it in code, references to another potential fortress were vague enough that only someone familiar with them should be able to understand what he had written down.

Other parts of the message were less vague. A potential invasion on the burg chief among them.

“There is a lake in the center of the forest,” Morford said in their usual whisper. “When I and…” They trailed off, hesitating a moment before restarting their sentence. “When I first came to this settlement and began my research, there was an old church-like building that I observed some monsters making their home of. Raptors, for the most part. We caught a ghast not far from it and neutralized it with one of my potions before dragging it away for examination.”

Looking into his crystal ball, Arkk focused high above the forest. From there, it was easy to pick out the lake. It looked completely landlocked. No river flowed in or out. “What side of the lake? Closer to the burg or the opposite side?”

“Closer, around the southern side.”

Adjusting the viewpoint in the crystal ball, Arkk started scanning. “Dakka, write what Morford just said on the parchment while I search,” he said.

Image after image flashed by in the crystal ball, flickering from point to point around the lake. The vast majority of everything he saw was just trees, unfortunately. Thick black-barked trees with branches high over the forest floor formed a thick canopy that blocked even more of what little light there was today. Those must have been the trees Darkwood had been named for.

He found it. He wasn’t sure if it had been a church in its former life, but today, the ruins Morford had pointed out were little more than a mound of rubble. A full pack of emerald-feathered raptors was nesting within the crumbled walls. Each was as large as a horse, capable of moving fast to chase prey. Their hooked beaks were sharp enough to tear through flesh as easily as the kingdom’s sharpest sword. Or so Arkk had heard; this was his first time seeing one.

Moving the viewpoint of the scrying down below ground, Arkk sucked in a breath.

A familiar sight greeted him. Large hallways lit by torches and the occasional glowstone. If he squinted his eyes and blurred his vision somewhat, Arkk doubted he would have been able to tell the difference between Al-Mir and this corridor. Upon looking closer, however, the differences were obvious. Instead of clean tiles with a faint maze pattern and compass rose in the floor, the tiles here were old and worn, cracked and broken. There were still glowstones, these burning a dim red as opposed to Al-Mir’s vibrant violets, but several tiles were simply missing their glowstones. Checking from room to room, he had to frown at the sight. Most of it looked dilapidated. More like how he had originally found Al-Mir instead of its refurbished look after the servants had gone through to clean it up. The rooms that did have items and occupants looked less like they had been constructed using the fortress magic and more like the occupants had simply dragged in whatever they needed from outside.

Still, it was there.

And disturbingly empty. Al-Mir had a lot of entirely unused rooms but enough of it had activity, even with the currently reduced presence of orcs within its walls, that he felt confident in being able to find signs of life if he had to scry his own fortress. This place, however, was deserted. That might have filled him with confidence had he not received that warning about invasion earlier. As it was, it only made him think that this other Keeper’s forces were already moving toward the burg.

“Write down—”

A faint flash of light in the guardhouse cut Arkk off. He blinked twice and found Vezta, hands clasped at her navel, standing in the middle of a freshly formed teleportation circle.

“Master, I—”

“Holy Light!” the guard cried out, staring at Vezta.

That was the *wrong* thing to say. All of Vezta’s eyes narrowed as an oily tendril lashed out from her arm, wrapping around the guard’s throat.

“Stand down, Vezta,” Arkk said as soon as he realized what was happening. “He isn’t an enemy.”

The tendril remained in position just long enough for it to look like she was going to snap his neck anyway. It uncoiled, letting the guard drop into a heap where he quickly scrambled back against the wall. The tendril merged with Vezta’s arm as she gave a light bow. “As you command.”

Letting out a small sigh, Arkk looked over his servant, then dropped his eyes to the ritual circle. “You came.”

“Another active fortress is unexpected and warrants extreme measures.”

“What do you propose we do about it? I assume you have suggestions?”

“We leave,” Vezta said. Arkk blinked a few times, not quite sure he heard her correctly. She took that as a need for explanation. “We take this circle out of the city. It took four hops to reach you here. We will only use this, the shortest distance teleportation. The rest we destroy on our way back to Fortress Al-Mir. After we have gone, we can reevaluate the situation at our leisure.”

“This other Keeper is going to invade,” Arkk said, frowning. “You want to leave these people to fend for themselves?”

“They are not allied with you.” Vezta sighed, then pointed a tendril toward the parchment. “And if it bothers you to such an extent that you would throw your life away, consider that this Keeper is invading for *you*. If you are no longer here, there is no cause to invade.”

“And who is going to tell this Keeper that I’ve left?” Arkk shook his head.

Stepping closer, Vezta put a hand on Arkk’s arm. “Master, many of Fortress Al-Mir’s capabilities are not functioning due to the Calamity. I have no reason to believe that this fortress is any different. However, the capabilities Fortress Al-Mir does provide heavily favor defense. Assaulting an opposing fortress without offensive power—or, indeed, an army—will see you defeated and me bereft of a master once more.”

“But that’s—” Arkk paused as he felt a tug on the link between him and one of the lesser servants. Checking on it, he frowned. “One of the lesser servants I sent out to find the fortress just ran into a fortified wall that it can’t dig through?”

Vezta nodded her head as if she expected that. “As I said, we lack offensive capabilities. We would have to find a proper entrance, go through it the way the opposing Keeper wants us to, and deal with his traps and minions. Minions that he can move about at will just as you can yours within Al-Mir’s walls.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. “What kind of offensive capabilities?”

Vezta cast a glance around the room, narrowing her eyes at each of the individuals present who weren’t affiliated with Fortress Al-Mir. Taking Arkk by the arm, she led him off to a corner of the room where they could speak in quiet, hushed tones. “There exists magic capable of rending the fortifications. Siege magic. I know little about *how* to go about affecting such spells but do know that my former master, as powerful as he was, was forced to lean heavily on the [HEART]’s magical reserves when conducting these rituals.”

“Is the Heart capable of supporting that kind of magic right now?”

Vezta could only shrug. “Unsure. The [HEART] gains strength with additional territory and minions. It might be possible. It might be impossible with the effects of the Calamity looming over us. However, in either case, neither of us knows how to cast those rituals.”

Arkk closed his eyes once more but before he could say anything else, a shout came down from outside the guardhouse. “Enemies at the gate! To arms!”

Vezta tried to pull Arkk toward the circle, but he shook her off. “We can’t leave.” Before she could protest, Arkk said, “We won’t attack the fortress. We will help defend. Then we need to be seen leaving the city. Is that—”

Another faint flash filled the guardhouse. Arkk blinked and glanced over to the teleportation circle.

Zullie stood in the middle, looking down at her hands with a loopy grin on her face. “That was a hell of a thing.”

“Zullie, you know any offensive magics?”

The violet-eyed witch looked up, offense written across her face. “Do *I* know offensive magics? Who do you think you’re talking to?”

“A woman who said she had never been in a fight when last I asked.”

“I don’t know what *that* has to do with my magical knowledge.”

“Good. Zullie is here for the defense too.” Arkk paused then tilted his head to one side. “What about siege magic?”

“Siege magic?” Zullie sounded less certain. “What exactly would that entail? I’m sure some magic I know could be used in a protracted siege…”

“Never mind.” Looking back to Vezta, Arkk placed a reassuring hand on her arm. “Defense then leave. Alright?”

Vezta let out a long, incensed sigh. “As you command,” she said with a bow.

“Good,” Arkk turned, nodded to Dakka, then started out of the guardhouse. He paused at Morford, however. The alchemist’s dark lenses were locked on Vezta. Thinking back, Morford had been staring at Vezta since her arrival. Obviously, Arkk couldn’t see them blinking, but with how utterly still they were, Arkk wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Morford hadn’t blinked once since that initial flash of light.

Shaking his head, Arkk moved past the alchemist without a word. Morford wasn’t a minion of his. He couldn’t command them around. Not to mention that he had maybe threatened Morford just a little bit ago to get them talking about the fortress. Better to just leave them alone.

With Vezta here, Arkk wasn’t too concerned about whatever this Keeper might throw at the burg. They had the guards to back them up and, assuming she did know combat magic, Zullie could sling spells from the walls until she collapsed from exhaustion.

A set of stairs along the wall granted him access to the ramparts. He probably wasn’t supposed to be allowed access. Nobody stopped him. A number of guards were rushing up ahead of him, all brandishing longbows. Vezta, Zullie, and the orcs followed him up, also unimpeded. Vezta did draw a few looks and even an alarmed shout. However, the presence of a monster standing peacefully on the wall paled drastically in comparison to what was lurking in the woods that hugged the road out of the city.

Arkk started to wonder if his confidence in fighting off this force was misplaced.

*Multiple* ghasts lurked around a large group of raptors and goblins, running counter to Morford’s claims. There weren’t many and they were spread across the rest of this… army? Insects took up the backline. They were larger even than the raptors with thin, spindly legs and large snapping pincers. Others were more bulbous in shape, drooling caustic yellow slime. Arkk didn’t know much about insect colonies like this, unfortunately. He had no clue what they were capable of.

It was a small consolation that this army numbered fewer than the horde of goblins that had attacked Langleey Village. There had been two hundred goblins in that encounter, though about half of them had fled once Ilya and the other villagers returned to offer support. This wasn’t even half as large. Maybe not even a third of the size. With the ghasts, raptors, and insects, he felt he would rather have faced off against four hundred goblins instead.

At the lead of the army, one ghast stood in front of the rest. One with bright red eyes, ominously glowing in the dark storm.

## 30 - The Best Defense


“*Electro Deus*!”

Lightning scorched the ground where the red-eyed ghast had been standing an instant ago. The ghast hadn’t jumped aside. It simply vanished. Arkk recognized the effect immediately as the same kind of teleportation he could do around Fortress Al-Mir.

“I did warn you, Master. It isn’t too late to flee.”

“Focus on the rest of them,” Arkk said, launching two more lightning bolts at the goblins attacking the gate. “Without an army, the other Keeper…” Arkk trailed off as the third goblin he tried to fry vanished much like the ghast.

It wasn’t just him either. Archers on the walls found their arrows passing right through where their targets had been. Farr’an tried to hit one of the snapping insects with a crossbow bolt, only for it to be whisked off elsewhere. Dakka and Orjja had procured bows from somewhere and were making efforts, but to Arkk’s eyes, it looked more like a waste of arrows than an effective battle tactic.

“*Electro Deus*.”

Five bolts laced out from each of Arkk’s fingers. Only two hit their targets. The Keeper was quick at getting the minions out of the way.

Zullie threw a few lightning bolts of her own. Like Arkk, the majority of hers struck nothing. Their combined accuracy was still better than any of the archers. Lightning was just a bit faster than arrows and they didn’t have to aim much at all. Just point and blast. Unfortunately for Zullie, she couldn’t maintain the output that Arkk could. After two or three bolts, she had to stop and take a short rest. That took out half their effective fighting force for several moments.

With a frustrated cry, Dakka shouted the incantation for lighting and fried a raptor that had tried to leap onto the wall near her. It looked like she tried for a second bolt but didn’t manage anything before collapsing, chest heaving up and down. Interesting though it was to note that she *could* cast that spell in a combat situation, Arkk was disappointed in her stamina with it.

Maybe training would increase her effectiveness? He would bring it up with Zullie later.

Arkk narrowed his eyes as he spotted movement in the distance. More monsters were approaching. Reinforcements? Or were they the ones the Keeper had whisked off coming back to rejoin the fray?

“He has territory nearby?”

Vezta, who hadn’t yet acted in an offensive capability as she stood next to Arkk, simply nodded her head. “I would expect nothing less.”

“We—”

Arkk cut himself off as a cry of alarm rose over the far end of the wall. A yellow and black striped insect had scaled the wall. One of the guards, bow on the ground and sword drawn, didn’t get a chance to strike out before the scythe-like pincers sliced him clean in two.

Arrows and crossbow bolts rained down as the insect started to lash out at another guard, only for the insect to vanish. That didn’t stop the arrows. One ripped straight through another guard’s thigh, eliciting a cry of pain.

The distraction allowed the forces at the wall to spring their attack. A ghast, using its powerful hind legs, leaped into the air not far from Arkk, intending to land on the wall somewhere near him.

“*Electro Deus*!”

A blinding bolt of lightning followed by a heavy thunderclap struck the flying ghast. Its limbs seized in mid-air but its momentum carried it straight toward the wall.

Tendrils erupted from the shadows around Arkk, ripping the ghast from the air. Arkk expected it to simply get whisked away to wherever the other monsters had gone, but it didn’t. Vezta’s tendrils wrapped around its limbs and began pulling, squeezing, and twisting. Pale blood dripped to the ground as if the ghast was a wet cloth being wrung. Finished, Vezta flung the broken body back into the crowd with enough force to crush a goblin.

“We should count ourselves lucky that this whole town isn’t within our opponent’s domain,” Vezta said in a conversational tone as she worked. “Not only would I not have been able to teleport directly to your side, but one of those large insects teleporting behind you would take off your head before either of us could react.”

“A few more of those and the wall will fall anyway,” Arkk said, looking around. “The Keeper just needs to kill enough guards to lessen the defense enough to where the majority of his force can rush inside unhindered. Until then, it is a battle of attrition and his teleportation tactic is giving him an advantage while depleting our stock of arrows. But…

“The Keeper isn’t fighting the way I would. He could have used his servants to burrow into the burg, bypassing the wall entirely. He is just throwing his forces at the wall. The heavily defended part of the wall no less.”

More reinforcements were coming to the gate. Soldiers from elsewhere. Even some of the mercenaries from the tavern.

Everyone was coming here.

“Dakka!” The orc wasn’t effective with the bow and couldn’t manage sustained lighting bolts. Arkk pulled out his crystal ball and tossed it over. “I need you to scry the rest of the wall. Make sure we aren’t fighting a distraction.”

“Me? Scry? I can’t—”

“It’s easy. If you can cast a lightning bolt, you can scry! Just think of where you want to see with a little touch of magic and the crystal ball will take care of the rest.”

“I… I can try.”

Arkk glanced at Zullie, who had given up on lightning spells in favor of some bird made of flames that swept outward from the wall before exploding in the middle of the monsters. It wasn’t killing anything—the wave of flame following the explosion wasn’t nearly as fast as lightning which meant that the Keeper could pull any monster that was in danger away—but it was doing a wonderful job of giving them some breathing room.

Vezta wasn’t actively attacking, but the few monsters that did make it within range either had to be whisked away before her tendrils could reach them or else she would crush them. It was like the Keeper couldn’t teleport anything away once she got her tendrils around them.

Both were too effective to put on scrying duty.

“Do it,” Arkk said, tossing the crystal ball. “Succeed and you’ll get a pay raise.” She tried to protest, but Arkk was already turning away. “Orjja!”

The green-skinned orc stiffened, loosing an arrow before turning to face him.

“Get down to the guardhouse. Take the teleportation circle. You should find another circle at the other end. Repeat that until you’re back at the fortress. I’ve shoved Rekk’ar and the other orcs into the armory—hopefully, they get the hint to gear up. Bring them back here.” Before she could offer the same protests that Dakka had tried, Arkk added, “You should be able to use magic enough to activate the circles.”

Orjja gave an uncertain nod to acknowledge the order but didn’t protest as she rushed down off the wall.

“Will a few orcs turn the tide?” Vezta asked, voice soft in the heavy rain.

“Not necessarily, but if we are being surrounded, I would rather have people I can count on to have my back,” Arkk said, eying a pair of the First Legion who were taking up the defense down the wall. “Can we destroy or otherwise nullify the Keeper’s territory? If the Keeper’s forces have to travel long distances after being rescued, that will at least wear them out. It should also slow down the attack, giving our side moments of rest.”

“Your lesser servants should be able to forcibly unclaim territory. They won’t be able to claim it in your name without territory of our own, but it would shrink our opponent’s effective area.”

Arkk, after launching a few more bolts of lightning, summoned a pair of lesser servants. “Burrow in that direction,” he said, pointing to where the reinforcing stream of monsters was coming from. “Find enemy territory and disrupt it.”

“They shouldn’t require verbal orders,” Vezta said, canting her head as she watched them leap off the wall and dive into the ground. A few monsters struck at the lesser servants, but they couldn’t follow into the tiny passages. The servants weren’t digging corridors or halls meant for others, just their own amorphous bodies. “The lesser servants are direct extensions of the [HEART]. *Your* [HEART].”

“So the ones I summoned earlier can be brought back to help those two?”

Vezta dipped her head. “For as much as they can help. You’ve seen them fight. The moment the other Keeper spots them, their mission will end.”

“They need escorts.”

“Master,” Vezta said, burning suns that were her eyes turning to bore into him. “Might I remind you that you said we were to defend *only*?”

Arkk fried a goblin and hit a ghast with lightning. The latter got back to its feet, unfortunately. “You know what they say about a good defense,” he said, gritting his teeth into a forced smile. “We just need to—”

“No *we* master. The Keeper is after you. If you step foot onto enemy territory, you will be surrounded and defeated in an instant.”

“If it is any consolation, I don’t think the Keeper wants to kill me. Just eat my brain.”

Vezta was not amused.

“I’m open to suggestions.”

Vezta drew in a breath of air and let it back out. “I will go after your servants. You will stay safe.”

“Will *you* be safe?”

Vezta’s eyes shifted back to the ground over the wall. She assessed for a moment before nodding. “If this is all the Keeper has, I won’t die.”

“And if he has more? If there is another of your kin around?”

“Then I will impress upon my sibling the utter mistake of attacking the master of Fortress Al-Mir.”

Arkk held Vezta’s gaze, looking for any sign of false bravado in her confidence. Finding none, he smiled. “Then I’ll leave this to—”

“Arkk!” Dakka shouted, moving closer with the crystal ball. “Sorry to interrupt. You were right. The guards along the northern side of the wall are dead. They look… eaten. Partially.”

Grimacing, Arkk looked back to Vezta. “If the Keeper is here, now might be the best time to go. Destroy as much as you can. Once you’ve been noticed, get out.”

Vezta hesitated, then bowed. “As you command.”

She backed up until she bumped against the waist-high barrier of the wall. She didn’t stop moving, tipping over backward. Arkk rushed over just in time to watch her land on her feet, somehow facing away from the wall. Tendrils covered in eyes and mouths whipped around her in a fury, striking at anything too close. The Keeper took note in an instant, ripping away any monsters that were within reach.

As soon as there was nothing left to attack, Vezta’s tendrils turned on her. They twisted around her, folding over and over as they tied her down into a tiny knot far too small to contain her full form. The tendrils turned and shrank until they were completely gone, pulled into the ground right where one of the lesser servants had burrowed into the ground.

A moment of silence covered both sides of the battlefield with Vezta’s departure. More than a few eyes turned in his direction. Even Zullie was staring down at the spot where Vezta had vanished. Arkk tried to pretend he didn’t notice. Instead, he used the momentary lapse in action to send a full-powered bolt of lightning at the nearest insect. The explosion of yellow globs of blood and viscera started the battle over again.

***

Twisting, roiling masses of tendrils erupted back onto the surface just after reaching a fortified wall through the narrow tunnel the lesser servants had dug. The entrance to the fortress was well hidden, poking out from a large boulder that might have been covering the entrance entirely up until this event started.

Vezta stared for a long moment, watching and observing as she tried to recall just who had commanded a [HEART] in this area. The area had the faint smell of death and decay still lingering even after a thousand years. The Eternal Silence, Vezta presumed. The only Keeper Vezta could recall who paid such tribute to the Eternal Silence would have been Duncan the Undefeated, who had obviously been defeated at some point over the centuries. Or… maybe he hadn’t. The Eternal Silence, a master of death and undeath, could have sustained a servant indefinitely.

Or so would have been the case before the Calamity.

As Vezta stood watching, a third lesser servant emerged nearby. Arkk had summoned five in total, three before she arrived and two after. She wasn’t sure where the missing ones were, but the three present should suffice for her current duty.

Disrupting the enemy’s ability to return their minions to the fight in a timely manner wasn’t a bad plan. It might make the opposing Keeper less inclined to rescue useless minions knowing that they wouldn’t be back in the fight for a long time in addition to tiring out those that did get rescued. It showed acceptable levels of tactical thinking, which was about all Vezta could expect from a novice. It was also a plan that only had a chance of success *now*. If the [HEART] of this fortress was connected to the [PANTHEON] the way it should have been, Vezta wouldn’t have made it more than a step inside before magical destruction rained down upon her for her insolence.

As it was, all she had to worry about were the monsters raining down upon her.

Vezta watched with narrowed eyes as a trio of monsters emerged from the long stairwell that led down into the depths of the fortress. None noticed the glowing eyes in the shadows of the Darkwood. They didn’t bother to look back, ushered along by their Keeper to continue their mindless assault on the human settlement. A pair emerged shortly after and another two after that.

Simply walking inside would see her caught. While Vezta had every confidence in her ability to escape, even should the Keeper make an appearance, the lesser servants would perish and thus she would fail her mission. Without the siege magics provided by a fully functional [HEART], burrowing inside wouldn’t be possible either. She could scour the area for an alternate entrance but that would likely consume too much time.

Vezta looked over the three waiting servants with a distasteful frown. If only she could carry out the task of destroying territory on her own. Alas, her former master had sacrificed much of her connection to [HEART] magics to make her a more effective advisor capable of autonomous thought and activity. It had been necessary for her to delve into the mysteries of the [HEART] failure caused by the Calamity.

Reaching down, she picked up one of the squirming masses of tentacles and began reshaping it much as she had done with the servant currently in charge of tailoring. Discarded bits and pieces fell to the ground around them as she rent the physical form of the creature, leaving it more or less in the form of a shadow between the stars. A few glowing eyes and one snapping set of teeth were all that remained. The rest of the darkness bled into the shadows of the brush under the trees.

Vezta performed the same treatment on the other two servants. They wouldn’t survive for long like this. They didn’t need to. Within the hour, she would finish her task and would finally be able to get her stubborn master away from this place.

Prepared, Vezta waited for a lull in the number of monsters emerging from the opening beneath the barrel. Her tendrils pulled her down into a shadowy form, though it wasn’t quite as hidden as while in Fortress Al-Mir or while near Arkk. The Keeper might notice if he paid attention. Some of the smarter minions could as well if they knew what to look for.

Entering the passageway with the other servants trailing after her, Vezta was surprised to find a total lack of doors. Had the Keeper relied entirely on the boulder as their method of defense? That, Vezta could only shake her head at. It was either an embarrassing display of incompetence, an embarrassing display of overconfidence, or an embarrassing display of ignorance. Whatever the case, her opinion of the Keeper fell even further as she continued down a long and straight corridor.

She no longer held any delusions that this might be Duncan the Undefeated.

The corridor was a mess. The tiles were cracked and broken and the gemstones, typical identifiers of [HEART] territory, were faded or missing entirely. Vezta could hardly believe that this area could count as territory without the linking stones carrying out the [HEART] magic. What were the servants of this fortress doing?

Vezta’s slithering march through the fortress corridor came to a pause as she considered that question.

Were there servants? Arkk only knew the spell to summon lesser servants because she taught it to him. If other servants of Vezta’s kind had withered away in the years since the Calamity, there might not be anyone around to teach the current Keeper of the [HEART]. Vezta was unsure how she had survived. The [HEART] going dormant without a master should have starved her. Instead, she had waited for a suitable master to come along and now lived to watch Fortress Al-Mir regain its beat.

Master Razerk’s modifications to her being might have been the cause. He truly had been a genius in the art of magic. If only he had lived to see her return with knowledge of what the so-called Light gods had done, he would have had the portal reopened in a week and the Calamity undone the next.

Thought discarded, Vezta pushed forward. If there were no servants in this fortress to reclaim the territory she destroyed, her task became infinitely simpler. She just needed to find the furthest junction of the territory. Fortress territory had to be contiguous for any given locale. If she disrupted territory as far from the boulder entrance as possible, she wouldn’t need to fight her way through minions every step of the way. Normally, that wouldn’t even be possible. She would have to start at the outside and work her way in on any proper fortress. Here? With the weak links between each tile?

She was honestly surprised that the fortification magic was still working. Destroying the territorial claim would be child’s play.

With the magic of the [HEART] disconnected, the servants would then be able to collapse the tunnel entirely, forcing the monsters to take a different route if the enemy Keeper wished to continue their assault.

Vezta found her junction after a few minutes of scurrying along the corners of the corridor. This tunnel was long and empty, much like those from Fortress Al-Mir that led to the nearby villages. It lacked the traps Arkk had installed and had no other defenses. Not even patrolling minions—they were presumably all involved with the assault. Vezta was disappointed with how easy this job was.

The servants under her command got to work with a mere gesture, fighting the weak magic of the dilapidated fortress’ claim on the territory. Vezta remained at the ready, fully prepared for the rain of minions.

Yet the tiles cracked and withered, collapsing to raw earth. As the last of the fortress magic dissipated from the area, a cascading effect ran down the corridor at Vezta’s back, destroying every tile and wall. Not questioning her good fortune at a lack of opposition, Vezta directed the servants to the walls to begin collapsing the tunnel.

Only after they burrowed within did the situation change.

A ghast appeared before Vezta, perhaps the same one from the initial moments of the assault. Frothing white foam dripped from its unhinged jaw as it looked around the corridor. Its tiny red eyes settled on Vezta after only a moment. Without a word or attempt at communication, it charged.

Vezta just waved, smiling wide as the tunnel collapsed down around it.

That wouldn’t have killed the Keeper. Even if he hadn’t been possessing a body, a simple teleport would have him extracted. With the collapse and no territory on this side, however, he was trapped over there.  Vezta did not know where other entrances were or if there was another close route. That should still stall him enough.

Perhaps more than enough. A small part of Vezta wanted to agree with her master. Crushing this interloper entirely both for offenses against the [PANTHEON] and being such an embarrassment toward Keepers of the [HEART] would have been gratifying. Still, embarrassment though this Keeper was, her reasoning from earlier had not changed. Especially not now that he had been alerted to her presence. He would be on guard if he wasn’t *completely* incompetent.

With a small shake of her head, Vezta turned and started walking back through the dirt tunnel, directing the servants to continue collapsing the tunnel behind her until they inevitably expired.

Upon returning to the burg, Vezta took stock of the situation as she approached. The gate had been bashed in but there wasn’t any fighting going on. Bodies stained the ground, most from monsters but a few humans as well. No living monsters remained. The Keeper must have pulled them back, possibly fearing that they were under further attack.

Ducking under a ruined wooden beam of the gate, Vezta’s many eyes swept over the scene. The knot of fear pulled taut deep within her chest.

Humans stood on one side. Orcs stood on the other. Arkk was on the ground, blood staining his tunic from a series of thick claw marks across his chest. Zullie crouched over him, muttering something as she drew her finger over one of the wounds. The skin behind her finger sealed together as she moved, but whatever magic she was using didn’t work properly. The skin split apart almost immediately and her spell wasn’t doing anything about the black veins spreading out from the wound.

“Master?”

## 31 - Flight from Darkwood


“—brought the monsters here!”

“—heard they were after him—”

“—attacked one of my own the day before.”

“You see the company he keeps? No wonder monsters—”

“The one with the eyes… you didn’t see the way it fought. Ripped apart anything that got near without even blinking.”

“My advice? Hide until this blows over. Keep the kids indoors and…”

“That ghast spoke. Said it would leave us alone if…”

“Speaking ghasts? Nonsense.”

“Doesn’t matter. This ‘Al-Mir’ group is bad news. Kick them out before they draw more problems to the burg.”

“And just who is going to do that? You? Don’t make me laugh. You soiled yourself when that monster of theirs—”

Zullie carefully closed the door behind her, trying to avoid as much noise as possible. Only once she was inside the small room did she lower the hood of her cloak. “Boss isn’t very popular, is he?” she mumbled, wishing the relative privacy of the stayover room did more to relieve the tension in her shoulders.

“Irrelevant,” Vezta said, eyes locked on the unconscious form of Arkk as he slept on in the bed. Several tendrils moved damp cloth over his body, trying to keep his body temperature down. “Did you discover anything?”

“I spoke with the alchemist they mentioned. Ghasts have some kind of toxin in their claws. He gave me this,” Zullie said, holding up a small crystal phial of clear liquid, “in exchange for about ten times more gold than I know it would take to make something like this.”

“Gold is no object.”

“Still…”

“Will it work?”

“Hope so,” Zullie said, stepping closer to Arkk. “The alchemist refused to come to see Arkk. Said something about Arkk threatening him. So, if it doesn’t work…”

Dakka, standing watch over Arkk’s bed not far from Vezta, bared her tusks in full with a low growl. “We go out there to rescue his girl from monsters and he repays us like this? It wasn’t even a real threat,” she snarled. “Should have left the girl to die.”

“If it doesn’t work,” Vezta said, voice unnaturally calm, “I will be the one speaking with this alchemist.”

Zullie suppressed a shudder. Her first thought upon meeting Vezta had been one of fear and shock. The monster’s appearance alone was unsettling. Knowing Vezta was pre-Calamity? That was another level of shock. One that quickly gave way to interest and curiosity once it became apparent that Vezta wasn’t going to eat her. The problems they had been working on together were fascinating, to say the least.

An alternate system of magic with truncated incantations alone was enough to draw her interest. Then Vezta brought up her reverse evocation problem. Punching a hole through planes of existence to reopen pathways that had been closed for over a thousand years? How could she say no?

Evocation, summoning, and likely teleportation—Zullie was fairly certain that the teleportation ritual circles used planar magic to dig tunnels through reality for instant transportation—were all classified as High Anathema by the Abbey of the Light. Zullie knew the theory of summoning but had never been allowed to practice or delve deeper than what was required for recognition. Vezta helped out with that. The pre-Calamity monster didn’t know how to work magic but she did know how to explain what she needed to happen in such a way that Zullie could formulate ideas about how to accomplish her needs if not full rituals.

With such interesting problems to work on, she had almost forgotten just what Vezta was.

Having seen Vezta in a fight and, later, frighten off a mob of angry people, Zullie doubted she would think of Vezta as just another researcher anytime soon.

Deciding to not tempt the ancient creature by staring, Zullie hurried over to Arkk’s side, uncapping the phial as she moved.

“Ingested, injected, or topical?” Vezta asked.

“Ingested. Can you sit him up?”

Tendrils formed from the shadows around Arkk, lifting him into a sitting position. Zullie winced at the sight. He wasn’t completely limp nor was he completely unconscious. He drifted in and out of lucidity. While her mending spell had sealed the gashes in his front after far more effort than she had expected, a bramble of blackened veins marred his chest, stemming from the thin scars the magic had failed to heal. Parts of the black veins were creeping up his neck, threatening to attack his face.

“Alright, Arkk. I need you to swallow this as much as you can.”

Zullie’s boss didn’t respond. Not even a blink of his eyes. Was he weaker than he had been before she left?

Yes. Almost certainly. They wouldn’t need a potion if he was getting better.

The alchemist had given her a long glass straw to use to carefully administer the potion without spilling any. Dipping the straw into the phial and then covering the end captured a small amount in the tube. With Vezta holding Arkk’s head back and his mouth open, she held the straw partially in his mouth—not far enough to trigger a gag reflex—and let it dribble out and down his throat.

His breathing paused a moment. Just long enough for a weak swallow. That was a good sign. Zullie had been worried about accidentally drowning him on the concoction.

Zullie continued, forcing him to drink small amounts at a time until she couldn’t capture a meaningful amount in the straw, at which point she upended the remainder into his mouth and hoped that would be enough. Stoppering the bottle and setting it aside, Zullie watched as Vezta gently set him back down on the bed.

“How long before we see…”

Vezta trailed off. It wasn’t hard to see why. The black veins around his throat were already pulling back. His breathing, formerly labored, steadied out. The potion worked fast, it seemed. That alchemist, though antagonistic, knew alchemy.

“Good,” Vezta said. “As soon as we confirm the stability of his condition, we will be leaving. In fact, we ought to leave before he regains consciousness to avoid any protests on his part.”

“How will we—”

A pair of sharp knocks interrupted Zullie. Her head snapped to the door, worried the angry crowd from downstairs had decided to throw them out. Or worse. She dismissed the notion almost as soon as it came. An angry mob wouldn’t knock.

Vezta stepped toward the door, unphased.

Zullie quickly inserted herself between Vezta and the door. “Maybe I should..?”

“I can handle myself.”

“It isn’t you who I’m worried about.” Zullie didn’t consider herself a creature blessed with social graces. Between a pair of angry orcs and an angry… whatever Vezta was, it was a bit sad that she thought she was the best option for a peaceful encounter with whoever was on the other side of the door.

Vezta stared a moment but dipped her head, clasping her hands in front of the eye that sat where her navel should be.

Taking a breath, Zullie carefully pulled open the door, ready to jump aside and let Vezta handle a potential angry mob. Only it wasn’t a mob at all. A well-dressed man stood on the other side of the door, gently running his fingers against the stubble on his chin. He looked surprised before a small smile wrinkled his face.

“Ah. Good day. Is Mister Arkk…”

“Doing better, now that he has had a healing potion.”

“I’m glad to hear that. I… I heard the alchemist when he came in. Mister Arkk went to help a woman who ventured outside the walls, asking little in return for his assistance. The monsters would have certainly followed anyone back, including that alchemist, so I know the others downstairs aren’t speaking with the entire story in mind.”

“That’s… much appreciated,” Zullie said with a forced smile. “Mister…”

“Wolf. Aron Wolf,” he said with a nod of his head. “Wolf Trading Company.”

“I’ll let Arkk know. I’m sure he’ll appreciate your visit.”

“Ah. I’m not here just for good wishes. I wanted to warn him that the crowd downstairs is getting… rowdy. Several guards have shown up. I would try to explain what happened myself but the hysterics of the situation seem out of my control. Letting you know so that there wouldn’t be any surprises is the least I can do.”

Zullie drew in a sharp breath. That didn’t sound good. What were they going to do? Throw them into the stocks? Lynch them outright? Zullie glanced over her shoulder. Neither option seemed likely to succeed with Vezta here. Either option would turn bloody.

Zullie’s hesitation to respond cost her. Vezta stepped forward, offering a polite bow. “Thank you for your warning. We were just leaving.”

The man stiffened, eyes going wide. He tried to speak only to cough on a bit of spittle. His coughing fit died out as he took a step backward. “Yes, well, I…” He cleared his throat more, pointing a finger vaguely away from the door. “I just… Better leave before… Good luck.”

Zullie watched him scurry off down the hall and could only shake her head. Vezta hadn’t even been trying to threaten him and she frightened him off. Hopefully, Arkk wasn’t going to be upset that he might have lost the one friend he had in this town.

Closing the door, Zullie turned back to the room. “How are we—What are you doing?”

“Avoiding unnecessary conflict,” Vezta said, pushing open the large shutters over the window. Her tendrils had Arkk wrapped up, held aloft and away from the bed. “Out the window. Dakka. Orjja. Zullie. I’ll follow.”

Neither orc looked impressed. “You want us to fit through that?”

The window wasn’t a large one. It had no glass. A vertical beam of wood bisected the opening, cutting down the total space to one that Zullie felt she would have a tough time squeezing through, let alone Dakka or the marginally larger Orjja.

Vezta simply looked back to the window, considering the problem. Before Zullie could offer any alternate solutions to the situation, tendrils wrapped around the frame and ripped a portion of the wall away.

“Out.”

Dakka didn’t argue again. With a casual shrug, she kicked aside a plank that was protruding before hopping straight out of the window. Orjja followed immediately after.

“Maybe we should leave some gold for repair—”

The noise of ripping away the wall must have alerted those on the ground floor. Heavy stomping moved up the stairs. Flipping the latch on the door, Zullie hurried over to the opening.

Vezta was already climbing out, using extensions of her tendrils to lower herself and Arkk carefully.

It wasn’t that high of a drop. The ground below was muddy and slick. Zullie’s mind started flipping through every spell she knew, trying to find one that wouldn’t have her breaking her leg if she landed poorly. A heavy slam against the door behind her made her mind go blank. Splinters of wood broke away from the latch with another heavy thud.

“Vezta!” Zullie shouted, jumping.

She wasn’t going to land well. Her arms spun through the air. She wasn’t just going to break her leg, her neck was going to snap against the muddy ground.

Oily black tendrils reached up and looped around her, slowing her down until her feet touched the ground as gently as if she were stepping down from one of the library’s ladders.

“Thanks.”

“Hurry,” Vezta said, not even stopping. “Arkk would be upset if I were to start a fight here.”

Zullie didn’t need telling twice. The angry shouts from above were more than enough motivation to rush through Darkwood Burg.

They rushed through the streets, moving directly toward the gate where all the fighting took place. Rekk’ar and the rest of the orcs stood outside the guardhouse, protecting the ritual circle within from a small contingent of guards who wanted to get back in. Zullie was honestly surprised that there hadn’t been a fight yet. Rekk’ar looked more than ready to start one.

The posturing of the guards died down as soon as one spotted Vezta approaching. Some must have seen her fight. They quickly pulled the rest away, granting them a wide berth to enter the guardhouse.

“Zullie. Get the orcs through the teleportation circle.”

“We’re taking the circle out? Arkk wanted to be seen leaving.”

“Then he should have been more careful.”

Zullie pressed her lips together but didn’t argue any further. It wasn’t that she was afraid of Vezta. The pre-Calamity monster did creep her out somewhat but she was fairly certain they had a good enough rapport between them to not come to actual conflict. Her lack of further protest stemmed from a definite desire to leave Darkwood behind and never return. Teleporting was simply the best way to put as much distance between her and the monster-infested woods as possible.

One by one, the orcs stepped inside. Zullie knelt next to the teleportation circle, activating it for each with only a small delay between. They all had done this before and knew they needed to clear the exit point as fast as possible.

There were more than just orcs inside the guardhouse. Two of those creepy lesser servants sat in one corner, bubbling and staring at everything while mouths and eyes formed and reformed across their pustulate skin. As Orjja, the last orc, made it through the portal, Zullie glanced at Vezta. “What about the servants?”

“Send one of them.”

“Only one?”

Vezta pointed a tendril at one. It carefully repositioned itself within the ritual circle. With a shrug, Zullie pushed out some of her magic. In a flash, the servant vanished.

“The other?”

“It will destroy the ritual circle after we have left then burrow straight down and discorporate,” Vezta said, narrowing her eyes at the few guards brave enough to stand at the doorway and watch what was going on. “Don’t want anyone following us.”

“Discorporate?”

“Kill itself.”

Zullie winced. “Is that really necessary?”

“It is just a lesser servant. It barely has thoughts of its own.” Vezta looked off into the distance over the heads of the few guards in the doorway. Zullie could hear shouts approaching. “Through the portal.”

“Sure.”

Zullie stepped inside and, with a light touch of magic, she found herself out in some nondescript forest. The same one she had traveled through on the way to the Darkwood Burg. The orcs stood around, casually chatting as they waited. They hardly took note of her presence, watching for Vezta and Arkk.

The two emerged a moment after Zullie cleared the circle. Vezta immediately destroyed the circle she had just emerged from with a liberal application of tendrils and then started directing the orcs through the next circle. The heavy rain, which had thankfully stopped, had disrupted part of the circle but Vezta was quick to clean it up.

As Zullie sent each orc through, she watched them, observing the way they looked at Arkk and Vezta. The end of the battle had been chaotic, to say the least. Just before all the monsters had vanished, they had broken through the gates. Zullie hadn’t seen it with her own eyes but she had heard from Dakka that, in the ensuing fight, Arkk had shoved Katt’am out of the way of the ghast’s claws.

Zullie barely interacted with the orcs. They lived in an entirely separate section of the fortress. Technically, she used the same mess hall for food. Practically, she ate at such odd hours that she most often scrounged through the kitchens to find food that she then took back to her room or the library. She wasn’t sure what relationship the orcs had with Arkk prior to today. She wasn’t sure what they had now, only that several were shooting him looks that she couldn’t quite parse.

Vezta left behind their final lesser servant to destroy the portal and then kill itself once again. The thought made Zullie a little ill at how callously Vezta just threw them away. Sentient or not, ugly though they were, she still found it disturbing to a degree. If Arkk was conscious, he probably wouldn’t have stood for it and would have insisted that they walk all the way back.

As Vezta destroyed the next teleportation circle without them traveling through it first, Zullie almost wished there were more lesser servants to facilitate their speedy return to the fortress. Almost. Not quite.

“Find the nearest burg or village,” Vezta said, holding out Arkk’s crystal ball. “We’ll head there for rest and transportation.”

Zullie couldn’t help but sigh as, an hour later, she located the nearest village far enough away that it would probably take the rest of the day and even part of the night to reach.

*Maybe a little more than almost*.

## 32 - Darkwood Defense Aftermath


“We’ve been searching for a week across this soggy marsh,” Olatt’an grumbled. He slapped at his arm, crushing more than one mosquito. “The exercise and fresh air were nice for a time. These bugs are not. How long are we going to keep looking?”

“They have to be here,” Ilya said, frowning at the bit of cheese on her stale bread.

She knew as well as he did that their time was running out.

Their provisions were running low. The wet marshlands and accompanying insects were irritating the orcs she had brought along with her. A week of trudging through the marsh, both on foot over the large islands and on a boat for crossing the wide channels, might have been fine if there had been an end in sight. At this point, they were just wandering aimlessly.

“My mother said that if I ever couldn’t stay with the people of Langleey Village, I should seek out the elves of Marrowland Fen. They would take me in.”

Olatt’an looked over the despondent elf. She caught his eyes wandering over the few other orcs who were taking a rest before ending up back at her. “Your mother,” he said, voice soft. “She lived in the human village for most of her life?”

Ilya raised an eyebrow. “She had a very long life. I… I was only a small part of it.” Maybe that was why her mother hadn’t looked happy to see her. Alya was over six hundred years old. Ilya was thirty-two. Only half of which had been spent in the presence of her mother. For the rest of Ilya’s life, her mother had been with the Duke.

The thought made her shoulders slump.

“When was the last time your mother visited her people? Didn’t she have a more accurate location?”

Ilya looked over at the toothless orc, pressing her lips together. She didn’t know. Her mother hadn’t left Langleey in the time since she had been born. From stories the other villagers told her, Alya had been a part of their village for at least a generation. Even the older villagers remembered Alya as children. Whether or not she left and returned at any point, Ilya couldn’t say.

“None of the villages we passed could point us toward an elf village,” Olatt’an said, voice still soft. “All they said was that elves would show up on occasion, but haven’t for a long while.”

Ilya swallowed a lump in her throat. “If they aren’t here anymore, where did they go?”

“Can’t say. I don’t know elves. The only elf settlement I’ve visited was down near the border of the Duchy of Mystakeen and the boy prince’s Principality. That was decades ago. No idea if it is still there.”

“Could you take me there?”

“To the Principality? That’s months of travel. Not to mention…” The old orc wrinkled his nose. “Elves have long memories. I doubt my face would be welcome.”

Ilya rolled her eyes. “Is there anywhere that doesn’t have an outstanding bounty on your head?” Throughout the entire journey, Olatt’an kept a bandanna around his face and a hood up anytime they ventured into a settlement. Even then, he stuck on his own, avoiding anyone outside their group. Most larger burgs, he and the other orcs had camped well outside their walls.

Olatt’an didn’t get a chance to answer her. Kazz’ak came running up. Ilya noted that he came running up to Olatt’an, not her, despite her being in charge of this whole operation. He didn’t look particularly excited to speak. At the same time, there was a worried intensity in his eyes.

“We… found something, Ripthroat.”

Olatt’an gave the younger orc a flat look. It was subtle, but Ilya caught the way his head twitched toward her.

Kazz’ak turned his head first before the rest of his body followed, looking at Ilya. “We found something,” he said again with marginally less respect in his tone.

“A village?”

“It… might be better if you came and saw for yourself.”

Not liking the sound of that, Ilya wrapped up her meager meal in a bit of cloth, pocketing it for later. “Keep watch here,” Ilya said, probably unnecessarily. The older orc wasn’t making any attempt to stand as he continued to eat his own food.

Marrowlands Fen was a wet marshy location far to the northeast of Langleey Village, right on the border with the Sultanate. Some parts of it were open to the ocean, the same ocean that Cliff’s harbor sat on, but large berms of grassy land kept the salty water *mostly* out. Were it not for the water, the land would likely be an incredibly hilly landscape, bordering on mountainous. Instead, it was more like large rounded islands dotted the greenish water. A few of the larger islands held settlements, though none were at all prosperous and wealthy. Even for all the gold Arkk had given her for this voyage, they weren’t willing to part with too much food for fear of starving themselves. Their farms were small, constrained by the islands, and most of their meals came from the fish both in the ocean and in the marshes.

So far, Ilya and the orcs had combed over the larger islands. Both those settled and those barren. Upon discovering that the settlements that were here didn’t know about any elf villages, she had been hoping that the elves were hiding their home with some kind of magic that she, an elf, would be able to see through. Just like in the stories of old. Unfortunately, she had yet to locate any sign of that. Even if the villages were hidden, there should still have been elves moving around, farmlands that couldn’t be concealed, or any number of other proofs that her people lived in the area.

Instead of heading inland on this island, however, Kazz’ak took her along the shore down to the second of their boats. The one he and his scouting team had been using to circumnavigate the island in an attempt to locate any sign of habitation. He joined two others aboard. Ilya followed.

Rather than circling the island, however, Kazz’ak directed the boat away from shore. Ilya’s sharp eyes looked into the distance, spotting a large mountain on their left and a smaller yet hilly island on the right. Using a long pole to push the boat through the water, Kazz’ak set the heading directly between the two islands.

As the boat sailed away from the island she had been on, Ilya spotted something that they were going to hit. It looked like a large grouping of cattails and a mess of reeds. As they got closer, however, Ilya realized that it wasn’t a natural formation. Cut reeds, wooden planks, and netting made from bulrush sedges formed the floating island. There were… constructions on the island as well. Small foundations of what might have been huts in the past. Now, it was clear that they had fallen into disrepair.

Kazz’ak pulled the boat up against the reeds, partially beaching it on the fake beach. Ilya had to wrinkle her nose. The entire island smelled of rotting plants. She had to wonder how long it had been out here, floating around with no one to maintain the island. It was clearly artificially made and would have to have maintenance to keep it from completely falling apart.

Following the scouting team, Ilya stepped onto the floating island. It wobbled a bit under her feet. Not enough that she thought she was going to fall through it. In fact, in its prime, it might not have felt different from solid ground.

“This way,” Kazz’ak said, waving a hand as he started across the surprisingly large floating island.

Passing one of the straw pillars that might have been a hut, Ilya paused and knelt. Something was sticking out of the straw that caught her eye. A smooth wooden shaft. Gripping it and wrenching it out of the straw, Ilya scowled down at the chipped metal arrowhead.

Ilya looked up to Kazz’ak, about to ask whether the arrow was one of theirs, when she spotted something beyond the tall orc.

Corpses. A dozen bodies piled up. The flesh had rotted and the bones had been picked clean by carrion feeders. Stumbling closer, Ilya found the scent of decaying plants replaced with the foul stench of rotting meat. The remains were still intact enough to tell that they had been humanoid. Judging by the tall stature, long legs, and thin builds…

These had been elves.

“We searched the area,” Kazz’ak said, voice mild yet uncaring. “Couldn’t find anything of value, though I can’t tell if that is because everything was looted or if these people didn’t have anything valuable in the first place. The bodies all look older. No children or youth. More huts than bodies too. Slavers, I would guess.”

“This couldn’t be too old,” Ilya said, warring with herself between getting closer and stumbling backward. “A few months at most or this entire island would be gone.”

“Think there are other floating villages? We might have been looking in the wrong place by checking over all the actual islands.”

“I…” Ilya’s voice caught in her throat. “Where would slavers have taken them?”

Kazz’ak shrugged. “The chieftain wasn’t in the habit of selling captives,” he said without any shame toward his former profession.

Ilya clenched her fist around the arrow in her hand. She felt sick. Sicker even than when her mother had turned away from her at the Duke’s manor.

Could she do anything about her people being captured? It had been months ago, based on what she saw now and what the other villages in the area had said about elf visitors. They would probably be gone in the wind without a trace.

Ilya let out an inarticulate cry as she dropped to her knees, slamming her fist down into the reeds.

She could only hope that Arkk was having better luck than she was.

***

The fires burned. A beautiful red-white glow licked the stone bricks of the long corridor, dancing under the wild choreography of Agnete’s dancing fingers. She basked in the flickering light, letting the fire flow around her in a whirlwind of purifying fury. *This*, Agnete thought, dropping the burning remains of her long coat to better feel the heat of the flames against her skin, *must have been what humanity’s ancestors felt when they first lit their drab caves*.

Light bright and hot enough to ward off the dark and the evils that lurked within.

Agnete strode forward, indomitable and relentless. The flames moved ahead of her, attacking all without mercy. Squeals of goblins, shrieks of fleeing insectoids, dismayed cries of all kinds of monsters… None reached her ears as her flames burned sound itself.

One of the mockeries of humanity appeared directly in front of her, claws already swinging through the air. Its hairless body caught fire the instant it manifested, but that didn’t stop its momentum. Agnete didn’t try to dodge. The monster’s claws skewered deep into her side.

A geyser of white flames erupted from the wound, fully engulfing the red-eyed ghast even as they burned away at Agnete’s skin. The keratine of the claws evaporated in the heat, leaving a wound that quickly seared itself shut. Mere pinprick scars remained behind. Agnete’s march forward didn’t slow in the slightest.

As the ghast died a fiery death, black smoke emerged from its disintegrating corpse. Bright red eyes glared at Agnete just long enough for the monster within to realize its mistake in approaching her. The black smoke burst into flames, causing the intangible being to fully manifest before her.

A human. Greasy black hair with a pointed beard. Neither remained on the screaming man’s face for more than a few seconds before being consumed by the flames. His purple robe and high collar caught fire and his skin began to char, but Agnete didn’t get to enjoy the process of purification before the man disappeared as quickly as the ghast had appeared.

Agnete continued forward through the hallways of this underground fortress. She didn’t make it far before a shudder in the ground threatened to throw her off her feet. A loud noise of breaking earth followed, bringing with it a blast of air coursing through the tunnel with such intense force behind it that it actually managed to snuff out her flames. Agnete’s fingers melted the stone wall, creating a handhold to keep herself steady.

As the wind died down, Agnete found her attention drawn to the wall she was gripping. Or had been gripping, rather. The thick stone bricks, reinforced with magic to the point where they managed to avoid more than cosmetic damage from the intense heat of her fires, began to crumble to dust, revealing bare dirt walls. The tiles under her feet, cracked and broken yet were still similarly reinforced, decayed.

The curiosity about the deteriorating fortress became a non-concern as a chill in the air made the hairs on Agnete’s arms stand on end. She drew in a breath, preparing to flood the area with the hot comfort of fire once again, only to hear a voice behind her.

“That is enough.”

Dry lips cracking into a snarl, Agnete turned around to face the one who *dared* dampen her heat. A man stood in the dirt tunnel, tall and lanky. Arms like noodles and thin glasses perched on his nose, he wasn’t a threat. He should *burn* for his—

The man reached into a pocket in his long black coat and withdrew a small clear marble. White fog of condensed air flowed around the man’s gloved hand, drifting to the floor like a waterfall of cold.

Agnete sucked in a breath, taking a fearful step backward. Ice replaced the molten heat in her veins as she stared with wide eyes. The ice crept inward, moving from her fingers and toes toward her burning heart. She opened her mouth, letting out a dry, croaking scream.

“I said *that is enough*, Purifier.”

Fight or flight kicked in, except she couldn’t manage either. Her feet had frozen to the ground and the fire contained under her skin diminished to mere embers in the presence of that marble of ice. All she could manage was a clipped nod of her head. Agree. Bow down to the ice in the hopes that it would grant mercy.

The man stared, a humorless smile plastered on his face. Nodding in satisfaction at *something*, he clasped his hand around the ball of ice and dropped it back into his pocket.

The moment it was away, Agnete collapsed, curling up into a tight ball on the dirt floor. She shuddered, rubbing cold fingers against her arms and legs in an attempt to bring back some of that heat from earlier. Slowly yet surely, feeling and warmth returned to her. It didn’t return in the same force. The out-of-control boil that threatened to spill over turned to a low simmer capped with a lid to avoid the possibility of that marble coming back out.

“Pick yourself up, Purifier,” Darius said, voice as cold as the marble hidden in his pocket. The disgust in his tone said more than words ever could. He stepped over her even as her shaking arms tried to heft herself up.

He held out a gleaming brass lantern. The white orb within was a gift from the Light, allowing vision even in the darkest of environments. Agnete hated the thing. For all its brightness, it had no heat. One could reach through the bars of brass and feel nothing at all.

Agnete stumbled to her feet, arms clasped tight to her body. She had to grind her teeth together to keep them from clattering. She dared to take her eyes off Darius, looking around back where they had come from. Sure enough, the short chronicler was coming up from behind. Holding a tablet in one hand and a pen in the other, he scribbled a few notes down. Probably ones related to her, how she almost lost control and burned them all or just how long it took her to recover from exposure to the marble. Whatever they were, she didn’t care at the moment. Her eyes were locked on the articles of clothing draped over the crook of his elbow.

Douglas squinted up at her, then, reluctantly, handed over a fresh pair of trousers and a long coat. He dropped the boots from under his arm and then continued after Darius without a word. Glaring after him for a long moment, Agnete tore off the remains of her burned clothes and began dressing herself. First the trousers, then the coat. She did up the six buttons across her chest before ducking down to don her boots. Once the buckles were secure, she let out a small sigh. The barrier between her skin and the cold air outside wasn’t much, but it helped.

Straightening her back and squaring her shoulders, Agnete began marching after her two fellow inquisitors. She didn’t speak when she caught up with them, merely falling in step behind Douglas. Agnete didn’t pay attention to the crumbling fortress around her, letting Darius lead them through the now silent corridors. He paused at a few intersections and peered into a few rooms, but didn’t stop until they reached a room unlike any other.

It was a large and rectangular room with a circular pit in the very center, surprisingly intact despite the ruins the rest of the fortress had turned into. Four thick columns stretched up, not quite reaching the peaked ceiling of the room. Each held carvings of profane symbols. Thick metal chains dangled into the pit from the tops of the pillars, perhaps having once held something aloft. Whatever that something was, it was gone now.

Stepping up alongside Darius at the pit’s precipice, she peered down into inky darkness. Not even the light from the holy lantern could penetrate the depths.

Douglass sat back, muttering under his breath into a small golden pendant that he wore around his neck. Prayers to the Light, asking for information. He paused and, with a nod of his head, looked over to Darius.

“Divine inspiration doesn’t tell me what this is. It… wasn’t so much of a non-answer as it was a rejection and refusal to answer.”

Darius frowned, dragging his long fingers from his cheeks to his chin. “Whatever it was, it seems to be gone now. Was it the purifier’s fires?”

“That information was not revealed to me,” Douglas said, squinting as he motioned to the chains dangling from the pillars. “All I was told was that we removed a great evil from this world.”

“Well,” Darius said, clapping his hands together with a false smile. “Not what we came here for. It is gratifying to know that we could eliminate an object of ancient evil nonetheless. If only the horror had been present.”

Douglas flipped back through his notes with a thin-lipped frown. “The truth is difficult to discern from an angry mob, but reports place the horror as defending the burg from the creatures of this pit.”

“Curious, isn’t it? Eyewitnesses put our old friend Mister Arkk working alongside it once again. I do wonder what dark magics he had to invoke to gain such control over a creature like that.”

Agnete, head remaining still, shifted her burning eyes to the back of Darius before flicking them back down into the deep pit.

“Perhaps it is time to visit that lovely village of Langleey once again,” said Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox.

## 33 - Evocation


“Evocation is considered a lost art of magic. To the best of my not-inconsiderable knowledge of magic, no attempt at evocation has succeeded since the Calamity. There are highly detailed records, so we know it was an actual branch of viable magic at one point in time. To make matters more complicated, evocation, along with all planar magic, has been deemed High Anathema by the Abbey of the Light. Anyone caught researching or otherwise engaging with planar magic is immediately charged and, without trial, sentenced to summary execution.

“At the academy, we were taught enough to recognize when planar magic was involved so that we could abort whatever we were doing and seek absolution with the church before it got to the execution point. Nothing else.”

Arkk grimaced at Zullie’s explanation. “And you want to research it now? Even knowing that consequence?”

“Already have,” Zullie said with a wave of her hand. “I told you before that I’ve got experience dodging inquisitors. They weren’t hounding me because they were interested in my ability to stop incoming projectiles. There have been accusations against me in the past. Nothing anyone could prove,” she added with a grin.

“Why is it banned?” Arkk asked. He doubted he would change his mind about proceeding with their evocation magic to reopen the portal. The inquisitors thought Vezta was an enemy. Their opinion was clearly flawed. Still, it would be good to know.

Zullie, one arm across her chest with her hand holding the elbow of her opposite arm as she gesticulated, launched into a lecture. It was starting to become a familiar sight. After their disastrous departure from Darkwood Burg, it had taken a little under a week to return to Fortress Al-Mir. Arkk had been too weak for most of that to protest their abandonment of the burg. When he had recovered enough, they were practically back. Scrying on the burg showed no additional attacks since their departure, so he hadn’t felt up to insisting they return.

Arkk had enlisted Zullie in magic tutoring on the way back, mostly to distract himself from what he thought was a fairly unpleasant departure. Not only was proper magic something he always wanted to learn but it also helped Vezta with her objective of carrying out her former master’s final command. The last few days had been… a lot.

Still, Arkk felt he had the basics down. He knew much more about rituals and how to construct them. Learning what all the little symbols and runes did in a ritual circle had clued him into what he was doing wrong that caused explosions when he tried to work most magic. Namely, an utter lack of direction toward how magic was supposed to flow through a ritual spell. In a great number of rituals, the undirected collision of magic caused the explosion.

He wasn’t quite so confident about jumping into forbidden anathema magics. That didn’t stop Zullie from her explanations.

“Evocation is a branch of planar magic, dealing with other planes of existence. It is a close relative to summoning magics—which also used to be a widespread branch of magic but has since degraded into demon summoning and little else. It is banned for that reason. Very little good can come from pulling bits of other realities into our own.” Zullie shot a curious look to Vezta, who simply chose to lean up against the wall for the duration of every lecture, before adding, “Or so says the church.”

“Fair enough. But we aren’t summoning demons.” It wasn’t a question.

Zullie laughed, waving her hand back and forth. “No, no. We’re not stupid. We’re just trying to punch a little hole into this Underworld place. No Hell involved.”

“And,” Arkk started, glancing at Vezta, “breaking through to the Underworld isn’t going to end this world or anything, right?”

“I don’t see why it would,” the servant answered. “The planes have been connected before without ending the world. We’re merely reopening a door that has been closed for a long time.”

Arkk nodded his head, accepting her answer as he turned back to Zullie. “You’ve figured out how to do this? Work some ancient magic nobody has gotten working before?”

“It helps that we have someone who has seen this kind of magic working, knows why it stopped working, and has a general idea of how to fix it,” Zullie said, motioning toward Vezta. “When I publish, I will be sure to mention your names in the footnotes.”

“Is it a good idea to publish anathema?”

“Of course! Posthumously.”

“Fair enough. So, how do we do this?”

“Not easily, unfortunately.” Turning around, Zullie approached the large table in the library and whisked a cloth off the top.

Arkk took a few minutes to figure out what he was staring at. Several vaulted iron archways surrounded a diamond-shaped pool of water. Thin bridges reached out from all four corners, stretching to a pentagonal altar in the center of the pool. Several tiny runes were inscribed on the altar, each so small that Arkk had to get up and squint down at it just to see. As he did so, he noted several other pentagonal circles spaced around the outside edge of the pool of water, one placed beneath each of the archways.

“It’s only a model,” Zullie said. “Vezta tried to explain the schematics that let you build rooms but I didn’t quite get it. Instead, I got that blacksmith orc to build this to my specifications. Hopefully one or both of you can figure out how to build a large-scale version.” Zullie pointed at the altar in the center of the pool of water. “That altar should be large enough to fit a full-sized orc within the inner pentagon. The rest of the room, likewise, expanded to scale.”

Arkk’s eyes widened. He didn’t know for sure without measuring it but just from a glance, it looked like the central altar would be roughly the size of the meeting room table. The room would be massive. Larger even than the orc barracks.

“It is modeled after the temple,” Vezta said, not moving from her position against the wall. “You may or may not recall the room with the large pool of water. That is where my former master beseeched the [PANTHEON] for their boons. The ritualistic elements were added by Zullie to facilitate our ‘evocation’ efforts.”

“And this will work?”

“Never seen evocation work, remember?” Zullie shrugged. “No idea if this will do anything at all. We’re venturing into the unknown.”

“If it doesn’t?”

“Hopefully, we learn something.”

Vezta shoved off the wall, stepping closer. “While I may not know much of magic, I do know a few odds and ends. Evocation, as Zullie refers to it as, was not a type of magic commonly seen. A layperson would not have the magical capacity to reach through the walls of realities. It was the type of magic that required several spellcasters, advanced preparation, and,” she paused, motioning to the model on the table. “And a lot of work. It is no surprise that such magics have died off. Even a large number of spellcasters wouldn’t be able to accomplish anything with the way magic has withered away in this world.”

“But we will?” Arkk asked.

“It will still require work and personnel, but Fortress Al-Mir will make what others find to be impossible *just* within our reach. We should have the gold reserves to cover the construction of the temple,” Vezta said. “It will cause a sizable dent compared to your other constructions, however.”

“Not like I’m using it for anything else,” Arkk mumbled. “I suppose I’ll have the lesser servants start digging? If you can get me the exact size of the room, that would be appreciated.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” Vezta said with a bow.

Arkk nodded, then looked back to Zullie. “I assume there is a little more to this than just building this temple?” Work and personnel. He could already see several points around the model that looked like they were intended for spellcasters.

Zullie let out a withering laugh. “A *little*,” she said with a snort before pointing at the central altar. “You’ll need to position yourself here,” she said. “From there, you need a spellcaster of at least my caliber at each of the four corners.” Her finger crossed from point to point. “Between each corner, at each ritual circle, you can have lesser spellcasters. I’ve been testing the orcs. Not many of those I’ve seen will suffice. You’ll need to find others for the remainder of the spots.”

Arkk did some quick math. There were five spots between each corner. Twenty in total. Ilya’s group of orcs had yet to return. If even half of those who had passed through the Fortress in the last few days were able to fill those spots, that was only about six orcs. Even if Ilya’s group were all able to fulfill Zullie’s requirements, that still left several empty places. And Zullie wasn’t sounding all that optimistic about the orcs.

Not to mention the four corners.

“Vezta can take one of the corners, right?”

Zullie shook her head, glancing at Vezta.

The monster’s many eyes narrowed ever so slightly. “Not exactly,” she said, voice cool. “My magical capacity is pitiful. I might suffice in one of the lesser ritual circles, but even that is uncertain.”

“Rather than have her perform that role, however, I believe she would be better suited to standing in the central circle alongside you. You provide immense magical power. She provides a symbolic connection to this Pantheon thing. Symbology is quite important in ritual magic.”

Arkk pressed his fingers to his forehead, closing his eyes. “I don’t suppose either of you has suggestions for where we might find three more capable spellcasters and several others for the lesser slots?”

Uncomfortable silence greeted him. It lasted long enough to force Arkk to open his eyes. He shifted his gaze from Zullie to Vezta and back.

“Anyone?”

“I went through a list of all my colleagues at the academy. Of the ones who might be capable of helping, I only came up with one name who might be *willing*. And he is a fairly big might. That’s the biggest problem. Anyone in good standing with the Abbey of the Light is more likely to report us than help us.”

“Great.”

One problem after another.

***

Arkk stood outside the Smilesville Burg garrison. Compared to the garrison in Cliff or even Darkwood, it was a wooden hut that wouldn’t stand up to a stiff breeze. Still, it had mercenary jobs posted. Mostly local affairs. Things that needed doing within about a day or two of travel from Smilesville. It did have a few larger warrants out for enemies of the Duchy.

Now that he had spent a few days distracting himself from his pessimism with other work, he had become a little more optimistic.

He was starting to think that this would work. The mercenary business at Darkwood hadn’t exactly gone as planned but it hadn’t exactly gone poorly either. Sure, he had wound up poisoned and had to be carried away from a potential riot. That was a bit of a downer. But upon arriving at the Smilesville garrison, he found a letter addressed to him from Hawkwood full of praise for the successful defense of Darkwood. Arkk wasn’t sure who told Hawkwood but that praise meant something. It meant someone was paying attention.

If Hawkwood was paying attention, perhaps, just perhaps, the Duke was as well. He had heard that the Duke often invited various prominent figures, including the leaders of mercenary companies, to his lavish parties. That, as far as he could tell, was the best bet for getting into contact with Alya. He and Ilya had written letters to her several times over the years and never received anything in response. Arkk wasn’t exactly sure what her situation was right now, only that the Duke apparently listened to her. So, forcing a confrontation using one of those parties would work best.

But that wasn’t why he had come today. At least, not the only reason. It was definitely something he was keeping in mind as he browsed through stacks of papers at the Smilesville garrison.

Unlike Cliff where they posted jobs out on a signboard unless the weather turned bad, Arkk had to enter the garrison and browse through their files. They just didn’t get used often enough to justify having them out in the open. That meant that Arkk could go through even the older bounties that had never been claimed.

One of which he recognized. The sketch of Olatt’an depicted a younger, tusk-filled mask of snarling rage. Seeing that might have given Arkk nightmares as a child. Now, he found himself confused over how the easy-going elderly orc could possibly be the same person as the one listed as wanted for nearly every crime it was possible to commit.

Sliding that paper aside, Arkk browsed through the rest. Paper after paper went onto the discard pile, making sure to maintain their order so that the archivists here didn’t get upset with him. Eventually, however, he spotted something promising. Another scowling face, this time of a human that looked about ready to eat a whole pile of babies. Most of the sketches were of scowling individuals. Very few had normal expressions on their faces.

The bounty was old. Posted about six months ago. Wanted dead or alive, Savren of Hope’s Rest was accused of practicing foul magics of the most awful sort. What exactly those foul magics were wasn’t listed. Still, Arkk figured this was as good as he was going to get for now. He flipped through the remainder of the notices but failed to find anything promising.

Leaving the rest of the papers in a neat pile, Arkk headed up to the archivist.

“Has there been any more information on this Savren person?” Arkk asked, sliding the paper across a wide desk.

The woman seated on the other side of the desk adjusted her round glasses as she looked up. “Savren of… Oh. The Hope Killer.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, not sure he wanted to ask but, at the same time, he couldn’t stop himself. “Hope Killer?”

“From Hope’s Rest,” she said, a slight nasal tone in her voice. “Put the whole village to rest, didn’t he now?”

“Killed a whole village?” Arkk said, mentally groaning. He had been paying attention to the magic listed on the paper, not what the man had done with the magic.

“No. Put some kind of sleeping spell over all eighty people there. ‘twas a few months ago and they haven’t woken up since. Mind magics.”

“But they’re alive?” Arkk asked with a frown.

“Sure are, but they don’t wake. Don’t eat. Don’t even breathe. Just sit, still alive but as good as dead,” she said. That sounded like a bit more than mind magic to Arkk but, even with Zullie’s tutelage, he was still far from knowledgeable. “The brightest spellcasters from the academy haven’t been able to wake them. As far as I understand it, they were taken to a larger church and are just… *stored* there until something can be done about them.”

“Then why Hope *Killer*?”

“Catchier than *Hope Rester* now isn’t it?” the archivist said, turning to a large paper-filled drawer.

“I guess,” Arkk said with a slight shake of his head. The possibility of recruiting this spellcaster was a little bit more palatable than it had been a moment ago. Zullie said that no one in good standing would help them out, leaving Arkk to track down people who *weren’t* in good standing. He knew what that *meant*, but he didn’t want someone who would callously slaughter an entire village.

He tried not to investigate the pasts of the orcs in his employ for much the same reason. At least most of them had fought against a demon summoning and were now making amends through honest mercenary work. More or less.

The archivist turned back with another paper in her hand. She laid it out on the desk, facing it toward Arkk. “Last news on Savren was reported three months ago. Other burgs might have more up-to-date information.”

“Spotted in the mines of…” Arkk started reading, only to pause as he recognized a name. It clicked a moment later. “Oh. Oh no.”

“Something wrong?”

“The mines of Silver City,” Arkk said, thinking back to his first outing to find mercenary jobs in Cliff. “I recognize that name. A den of gorgon moved in. It has been one of the largest outstanding mercenary jobs for… about three months. No one has dared take it up, I’ve heard.”

“Ah. Probably explains why we haven’t had any updates on Savren. He’s been turned to stone. Good riddance, I say.”

Arkk sighed, fearing he might have to go to a larger burg to find more information on spellcasters who might be willing to participate in an evocation ritual. “Mind if I get a paper to write all this down on anyway?” he asked. Might as well have Vezta scry the mines and see if it was full of gorgon or not.

If Arkk were trying to hide, starting a rumor of some of the most dangerous creatures in existence living around him would be a great way to keep all but the most dedicated of bounty hunters away from him.

The archivist handed over ink and paper in exchange for a silver coin. Arkk quickly scribbled down every bit of information, from the location of Hope’s Rest to the various villages Savren had been spotted in before winding up at Silver City. In the end, he thanked the archivist for her help and left the garrison.

He made it about three steps down the street before spotting something unpleasant. A black carriage, gleaming with the striped emblem of the Duchy on the side, sat just outside the local stayover. A familiar man with a wide black hat sat at the reins of the horses. Arkk didn’t stick around any longer. Ducking back into the alcove of the garrison’s entryway, just out of sight of the guards, he teleported straight back into Fortress Al-Mir.

And ended up in front of Vezta, who was currently trying to convert Zullie’s model into a useable schematic for construction.

“We have a minor emergency. Maybe a major one,” Arkk said, pulling a crystal ball to him.

Vezta canted her head to one side, looking away from the model to peer into the glass ball.

He held it out and immediately began scrying on the Smilesville stayover. The Smilesville stayover had an external staircase to four rooms, all perched over a tavern. It took only a second to flick through each of the rooms before finding the black-cloaked inquisitors in the third.

The short chronicler sat on the edge of the bed, reading from a small book. The purifier stood perfectly still at the window, watching outside. There was no sign of Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox, but something about the purifier sent chills up Arkk’s spine.

Adjusting the viewpoint of the crystal ball, he let out an audible groan as he noted the direction the purifier was looking.

If she had been standing there a few moments ago, she would have had a clear view of him stepping outside the garrison and then ducking back in.

“I need you to keep watch on these people,” Arkk said. “I’m sorry, but until they leave the vicinity, this takes priority over the temple room.”

“I can handle both tasks at once,” Vezta said with a mild bow.

“Good. Thank you.”

## 34 - Fortress Construction


“So, you’re saying I don’t need to dig downwards?”

Arkk stood in the middle of the largest room in the fortress. It took a full week for Vezta to convert the model temple room into a workable schematic. The room itself had been ready in two days. Compared to digging a straight line, where more than one lesser servant would just get in the way of any others, digging out a large room made space for many others.

But he was a little confused about the specifications Vezta had given him.

“The pool is supposed to be deeper than the floor of the room, which will be roughly where the floor is right now,” Arkk said, looking down at the tiled ground.

“The schematic was designed with this floor level in mind. Interestingly enough, should you decide to dismantle the room following the ritual, the floor will return to this level.”

“How?”

Vezta shrugged. “Fortress magic.”

Arkk gave the servant a flat look. “Considering I’m in charge of this place, I feel I should understand how it works a little better.”

“Even my former master didn’t understand all its nuances. I doubt any but the [PANTHEON] know how it functions.”

Zullie looked between Arkk and Vezta with a small shake of her head. “I’m still hung up on the fact that you can convert gold into entire rooms filled with all kinds of different matter. Gold is alchemically pure and magically inert. Introducing impurities the way you are should be impossible.”

The witch had a point, he supposed. The room construction itself wasn’t something he understood either, he had just come to accept it as part of the fortress. The whole place was as much a mystery to him as it had been the day he found it. It was just that it was *his* mystery.

Reaching into the treasury, Arkk pulled over several piles of gold. Almost a third of what he had collected thus far. A few months ago and he would have died from shock at *seeing* this much gold. Knowing it was all his still caused an odd sense of disassociation. “I really hope this works,” Arkk said. It didn’t quite feel real. Throwing it away on a flawed ritual would still hurt.

Taking a breath, Arkk focused on the schematic in his mind. Vezta, like the other schematics, had communicated what was needed in the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE], which shoved the concept of how to go about building this place straight into his mind. It wasn’t so much that he *knew* what needed to happen as it was that she had developed an instinct for it within him. However it worked, he could *hear* it working even with his eyes closed. Like an archivist using an enormous wooden block stamp to mark papers, the room around him shifted and changed.

Opening his eyes, Arkk looked around. The tiny model from a week ago had blown up to a truly staggeringly sized room. He, Vezta, and Zullie all stood in the direct center of the room, atop a platform with a detailed ritual circle carved into its surface. Intricate metal archways lined the edge of the pool, both around the central altar and on the far sides beyond the narrow bridges. Each bridge, stretching out in cardinal directions from the central altar, was engraved with a long pattern of maze lines quite similar to those in the [HEART] chamber and a few other areas around the fortress.

The maze designs on the bridge had Arkk frowning as he knelt to inspect the lines. “This wasn’t in the schematics. Is it going to cause a problem?”

Zullie joined him, bending to run a hand over the faint indentations in the stone walkway. “I’ll have to double-check whether or not magic is being channeled through these areas. If so, the design will likely cause resistance as the magic tries to work its way through the maze. That could cause a cascading—”

“It shouldn’t be a problem,” Vezta said, standing tall just behind the two of them.

“And how can you say that? You don’t even know how this ritual works,” Zullie said, looking over her shoulder. “Need I remind you that you left its design to me?”

“This is true. However, while you may know magic, I know Fortress Al-Mir. It wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize the intent of a room.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow at that, turning to Vezta. “Is the fortress alive?”

“The beat of its [HEART] is the beat of your heart.”

“I mean, how does Fortress Al-Mir know what the intent of the room is?”

“You know. It knows.”

“Alright. But I don’t know. I might be learning a bit about proper ritual construction from Zullie but this reverse evocation ritual is about a hundred levels beyond me right now.”

Vezta just shook her head. “[Fortress Al-Mir]/[HEART]/[Arkk]|[created by]/[placed by]|[PANTHEON]/[beings above all]. Attempting to comprehend the inner workings is likely an exercise in futility that— Zullie, I would recommend against touching the water.”

Arkk looked back to find the witch near the edge of the altar platform, hand stretched out over the glassy surface of the utterly still liquid. Her hand snapped back as Vezta spoke, looking at the servant with alarm.

“Why? It should be regular water.”

“The majority of this room is based on the temple. Arkk, you may recall passing a room with a pool of water during your initial exploration of this fortress.”

“I didn’t investigate too closely, but yeah. I remember. The lesser servants had eaten it by the time I thought about exploring this place later on, unfortunately.”

Vezta dipped her head in a nod. “My former master used the temple to gain boons from the [PANTHEON]. To do this, he would offer something to the temple waters. It serves as a gateway between this plane and theirs.” She paused, canted her head, then added, “Things that cross over rarely returned and, when they did, never in the form they departed in.”

“But the planes are disconnected,” Zullie said. “Reopening the portal to one of those planes is the whole point of the ritual here.”

“Still a bad habit to get into.”

Curiosity getting the better of him, Arkk approached the edge as well. He trusted Vezta enough to not touch the surface of the water, but he was still interested.

The surface was glassy, looking more like a polished silver mirror than water. Except, while it reflected the world around him—the rest of the room—he didn’t see his own reflection as he leaned over the edge. Zullie, still near the side, should have been visible as well. She wasn’t. Just the violet glowstones set into the ceiling—which was a great deal higher than it had been before constructing the room.

“Your former master would put something in and get something else in exchange?"

“This is correct.”

Pulling a gold coin from the treasury, Arkk held it in his hand for a slight moment before tossing it out into the water.

It slipped through the surface without causing any disturbance. Not even the slightest ripple spread out. The coin just disappeared. He couldn’t see it beneath the surface either. The way it simply slid out of the world made him shudder.

He wasn’t the only one. Zullie had almost the exact same reaction. As a chill ran up her spine, she slowly scooted back from the edge.

“This is no wishing well, Keeper,” Vezta said, though she sounded more amused than annoyed.

Arkk just shrugged. “You said to toss something in so I tossed something in.”

“Many rituals my former master performed were private affairs, even to me. I do know that he occasionally entered the temple room with captured prisoners and returned with loyal minions. Other times, he would enter with grand meals or livestock.”

“What if we tie a string to the coin?”

“I would suggest you do not offend the [PANTHEON] by attempting to retrieve your offerings. However, with access to the [PANTHEON] restricted, it is likely nothing will happen should you attempt your experiment.”

Zulllie’s eyes brightened for just a moment before she started scowling. “Great. Another magical mystery to add to my ever-expanding list. I’ve been here for a month and a half and it seems like my list doubles in size every other day.” She shot a glower at Arkk. “I don’t suppose you’ve had any luck recruiting more researchers? Or just laboratory assistants? An extra hand could go a long way.”

Arkk shook his head.

He hadn’t found anyone, not that he had an opportunity to try. Those inquisitors were still around Smilesville Burg. He hadn’t dared to return. In fact, he hadn’t left the fortress at all. The only thing he had done remotely related to venturing out had been ordering the lesser servants to dig a tunnel out in the opposite direction from Langleey Village, headed toward a burg roughly the size of Smilesville on the other side of the Cursed Forest. He didn’t know that Stone Hearth Burg would have anything that Smilesville didn’t, but at least it didn’t have inquisitors swarming around.

“I did scry on the gorgon mines,” Arkk said. “There is a human in there living with the gorgon.”

“Without being killed? A prisoner?”

“I don’t think so. I wouldn’t call their existence copacetic but the human does seem to be directing the gorgon around. The archivist mentioned something about mind magic. I assume that is how he has survived among them; he’s using them as his guards now. No idea how to approach that situation, unfortunately. I already know Rekk’ar and most of the orcs would riot and abandon us if I tried to tell them to go there.”

“Best to avoid that,” Zullie said. “We’re already short on people for this ritual.”

“I know. I’m thinking about solutions. It’s just those inquisitors aren’t making things easy. I *know* they’re here for me. Still, if I could get a message to Savren and offer him asylum in exchange for helping out in this ritual… The food alone has to be better than rats and mushrooms and…”

Arkk trailed off, squinting as he looked over the wide pool of water. While the pool was shaped like a diamond, the room was square. Each corner of the pool was at the mid-point of the walls.

Along those walls, he spotted several large pedestals that *also* hadn’t been in the schematics. Turning around, he found four pedestals against each of the four walls.

A few of them were occupied.

“What are those?”

Both Vezta and Zullie looked over, following his gaze toward one of the occupied pedestals. Following him, they crossed the bridge and came to a stop in front of a tall statue of a woman wearing a long, ripple-covered dress. She had her arms spread wide as she stood in front of an engraved decoration that looked like a tall closed door. The door had two half-circles, one on either side, that looked almost like large glass windows looking out onto a field of stars. The stars were just tiny glowstones, however. The door didn’t open either.

Probably.

The magic of the fortress could be strange at times.

Large thin tendrils reminiscent of Vezta’s extra limbs reached out around her from the false door, winding around her arms and wind-blown wavy hair. A large orb at the center of her dress looked like an eye, though not like Vezta’s many eyes. It was more like a mechanical depiction than burning suns set into a void.

Vezta gave a deep, respectful bow toward the statue. “Xel’atriss, Lock and Key. The member of the [PANTHEON] holding dominion over barriers, locks, boundaries, and separation. The Lock and Key’s presence is likely a good sign, indicating that we are on the right track.”

“It is just a statue though,” Arkk said, hesitated, then added, “Right?”

“This place is more connected to the [PANTHEON] than any other physical location in this world. If anyone can breach the barrier separating them from us, it would be the Lock and Key.”

That didn’t answer Arkk’s question in the slightest. Still, Arkk didn’t see any sign of intelligence or movement in the violet gemstones that sat in place of the statue’s eyes. Turning to the pedestal two away from this woman, Arkk asked, “What about that one?”

It wasn’t human. Humanoid, yes, but not human. With a head like the skull of a goat, four sets of horns stretched out in a long and tangled mass that wrapped around the depiction of the creature like a briar thorn bush. It held both hands in front of it, one hand above the other. An hourglass *floated* between, rotating end over end to keep the sand within from ever emptying fully into one side.

“The Jailer of the Void. Time. Eternity. Emptiness,” Vezta said, offering another bow to the statue. “I’m not sure why this one would appear.”

Arkk waited but Vezta didn’t have anything more to offer. Instead, the servant narrowed her eyes as she looked at another wall. Another pair of statues occupied two of the four pedestals.

The first was a woman cast entirely in gold armor with a large heart-like object placed within the breastplate. The headdress she wore over her full, curly, and golden-brown hair was large and extravagant, making her look like some kind of royalty. The serious expression on her face reminded Arkk of some of the times Abbess Keena gave the occasional harsh Suun lecture.

On the other end of the rows of pedestals, a tall man stood clad in golden light that hurt Arkk’s eyes to look at. Much of his chest was bare with only those thin lights of gold stretched between his muscles. He had a chiseled, angular jawline and short hair. Like his chest, most of his face was hidden behind a form-fitting mask of golden light.

“The Heart of Gold and the Holy Light,” Vezta said with ill-concealed hatred. “Traitors.”

From her tone of voice, Arkk didn’t think it was wise to ask further questions about these two. The servant turned on her heel, fists clenched as she strode across the bridge to the opposite wall.

Only one of the pedestals was occupied here. The last of the sixteen with a statue in place. This one was of another muscular man with longer hair striking a heroic pose. A spear in one hand and a staff topped with a fleur-de-lis in the other, the ends of both were planted near his feet. A long billowing cape was frozen in the air behind him, though Arkk wasn’t sure how it was attached to him. The man didn’t have a shirt on and, below a washboard of muscles, he only had a wrapping of cloth around his hips. Two feathery wings sprouted from his back, giving him the visage of a particularly humanoid harpy.

“The Almighty Glory,” Vezta spat. “The three instigators of the Calamity. Trapping the rest of the [PANTHEON] while they run free? Betraying their sisters and brothers to elevate themselves? Disgusting.”

“Should we… destroy these statues or something? If that tentacle woman is a good sign, surely these are the opposite.”

“I would leave them all alone,” Vezta said, her voice in a forced cool tone. “For now. In addition, I would suggest you avoid further experimentation with the waters of this chamber. Although I imagine it is unlikely that those present are watching us in any capacity, tempting that would be unwise. Avoid the room until we’re ready to use it.”

Arkk nodded, glancing toward the sole doorway. A translucent visage of a metal door appeared with his gaze. The work order would already be in the smithy.

“Right. Zullie. No experiments.”

“Am I the only one creeped out by these?” the witch asked, staring at the towering face of the Almighty Glory. “They weren’t in my plans.”

“This is the first room I’ve made that had unexpected changes,” Arkk said with a frown. He cast his gaze around the empty pedestals, wondering if they would populate after the ritual.

He eventually looked back to the Almighty Glory. Though he expected it to be looking down at him with his back turned, it wasn’t. The statue remained still and stagnant.

“As long as they aren’t manifestations of these beings…” He shook his head. “Let’s get out of here. Zullie, I don’t suppose you’re aware of any other outlaw spellcasters,” he asked as they started walking away.

Only Vezta remained, shadowy tendrils around her roiling as she glared at the tall statue.

Eventually, she turned away, putting her back to the statue as she left the room.

None of the five statues moved.

## 35 - Recruitment


“What do you think you’re doing?”

“Recruiting,” Zullie said.

Zullie stood in a recently emptied storehouse within Langleey Village, hands clasped behind her back as she paced back and forth in front of twelve villagers. Each of the villagers had a magic circle on the floor in front of them. They were simple circles, all of which were the same. Arkk easily recognized the spell to create a temporary, stationary light source. Despite the looks of concentration on most of their faces, only two circles were lit up.

Lips quirking into a frown, Zullie shook her head. “Well, determining whether anyone is worth recruiting. It isn’t looking good.”

“Of course it…” Arkk pressed his fingers to his forehead, rubbing away the headache. “Langleey is just a simple village. We’re not known for our spellcasters.”

“Not known for anything,” Zullie mumbled. “Still, there is *some* promise,” she said with a motion toward the two lit circles.

One was dim. Jorgen, surprisingly enough, sat in front of it with a scowl on his face. Not quite as big of a scowl as Hurtt, who glared with undisguised envy from the darkened circle one over.

Hale sat in front of the other lit circle. The young girl managed to coax a bright white light from her circle. She was one of the few without that intense focus on her face. Arkk wasn’t too surprised given her ability to use the teleportation circles *without* being contracted to the [HEART].

“You aren’t thinking of roping a kid into this, are you?”

“We need spellcasters and you haven’t had any luck.”

“I have plans,” Arkk said. “If those inquisitors weren’t buzzing around, I’d have gone to the gorgon mines already.”

Zullie looked over, eyebrow quirked above the rim of her glasses. “Really? You were going to go in there? Do you have a death wish?”

“No. Of course not. I wasn’t going to go in, just toss a message in and run away.”

“Great plan,” Zullie said, tone flat. “I’m not sure that one of these can take a corner position. I’ll have to do a few more tests. This whole charade was just to check on who was worth spending more time on.”

Arkk just sighed. “How did you even get here? And how come you didn’t mention anything about going.”

“I do have two legs,” Zullie said. “I wasn’t aware that I needed your permission to do my job.”

“I could have saved you the time it took to walk. And…” Arkk dropped his voice to a whisper. “I could have saved you the effort of testing this bunch.”

“Would you have mentioned her?” Zullie asked, pointing to Hale. When he didn’t say anything, she continued. “If she had been born in a proper burg or city, she would have been taken in as an initiate. I’m surprised the local abbess didn’t report her.”

Arkk frowned, thinking. “I haven’t been around the village much in recent weeks. But… I don’t think I’ve seen Abbess Keena in months. Huh.”

“She was spying from the door not too long ago. Disappeared just a bit before you arrived, actually. I tried to invite her in to test her as well—any proper abbess should be capable of taking a corner spot in the ritual—but she rejected me. Probably for the best given her profession.”

“I don’t think she likes Vezta much. Or me for bringing Vezta to the village.” Which was probably why the Abbess had been avoiding him. It… did sting a little. Especially because half the reason he had gone back to Vezta for help was that the Abbess reassured him that he wasn’t making a deal with a demon. “Speaking of Vezta, she was looking for you. Which was why I was looking for you.”

“Oh? Did she make any progress on her task?”

A half-smile spread across Arkk’s face. “Oh? You’re giving her tasks now?”

“I thought she was happy to be ordered around. As she keeps reminding us, she is a servant.”

“I don’t know that she is *happy* to be given orders… Maybe. What did you have her working on? More ritual work?”

Zullie waved a hand, dismissing the notion. “That project is effectively frozen until we’ve got enough personnel to proceed. No, I asked her to write down everything she knows about the older magic used by her former master. Every instance she could recall of him using it, what the effects were, incantations if possible. The evocation ritual was an interesting distraction but I came here to uncover the mysteries of your short incantations.”

Arkk couldn’t stop his sudden laugh. Reversing the Calamity and opening portals to other planes of reality were *distractions*.

At his laugh, the looks of concentration faded from most of the villagers around. Like a trance broken, everyone looked up to him all at once.

“Arkk’s back!” Hale chirped, only to steel her features in a sudden bout of embarrassment.

“Well, well, well. Look who deigns to visit us mere peasants.”

Arkk turned away from Hale to shoot Hurtt a flat look. He had thought they had been getting along better after the barrows. Seeing that same envious look from earlier directed at him now just made Arkk sigh. “Hello. Harvest went well?”

Higgens made a show of looking around the empty storehouse. “Well enough that the taxman felt he could take the entire stock we had here.”

“Only one storehouse to get us through the winter,” Jorgen grumbled. “Going to have to tighten our belts. Especially with you and Ilya not bringing any meat in.”

Arkk grimaced at that. True, he hadn’t been hunting. The sudden freedom and ability to travel that came with even a modicum of wealth had him focusing on other matters. Things that *felt* more important. Especially because Fortress Al-Mir provided food on its own.

“I might be able to help with that. I can get some chickens and pigs.” Arkk wasn’t quite sure how but a small portion of gold could be turned into living chickens and pigs within the pens and bread and vegetables in the kitchens. It was an entirely automatic process, providing plenty of meat for Larry to butcher up into passible if not good meals.

“Isn’t that mighty gracious of you, your majesty.”

“What Hurtt means to say,” Higgens said, shooting the larger man a glare, “is that help would be appreciated. We’ve been doing our best but no human can match an elf at hunting.”

Arkk gave the village tailor a flat look, knowing well that he had kept up with Ilya just fine. Mostly. He did have to wonder at just who they had been sending out in his place. Some of the younger boys, probably. Maybe he could have Ilya take them out for some proper hunting lessons when she got back.

With a quick glance through his employee link, Arkk checked on Ilya. The elf had been on her way back with the other orcs for a few weeks now. It did not look like they had accomplished their objective. They only had two new members of their group. Both were elves but they both looked like children. Elves did age a bit slower than humans, so they might have been as old as twenty rather than the ten to fifteen they looked. Even with that consideration, they did not look old enough to be master tailors.

That was a failure on two fronts then. Both his attempts at rapidly increasing Al-Mir’s renown and Ilya’s attempt to get them nicer clothes than the lesser servant could provide. At this point, it was looking like he might have to visit Cliff once again, this time with a sack of gold specifically for fancy attire. He was wealthy enough to simply purchase clothing outright.

All the fancy clothing in the world wouldn’t get them into one of the Duke’s parties, unfortunately.

Visiting Cliff again would give him a chance to meet with Hawkwood. Maybe Wolf as well. They might have some connections he could use.

“Alright, that’s enough,” Zullie said. She lifted a small wooden wand with a handle capped with a violet glowstone that looked like it had been pried off the walls or floor of the fortress. A small wave of the wand created a controlled gust of wind that swept away the magic circles. The only one she skipped over was Hale’s circle. “Come collect the pay I promised and get out,” she said, reaching into a pouch at her hip and pulling out a few silver coins.

Arkk’s eyes were stuck on the wand, however. He recalled something similar at the Cliff Academy. The spellcaster helping Zullie with her shield spell had used a large staff to fling the rocks at her and then later to collect them after the demonstration.

“How does that wand work?”

Zullie glanced over, perplexed even as she handed out coins to the departing villagers. “Right. I keep forgetting you have no magical training or even general knowledge.”

“Sorry. Your lessons are helping.”

“I should hope so. I would hate to think that I’m wasting my time.” Between handing out coins, she held out the wand for Arkk to take. “It is possible to imbue single spells into limited-use items like this wand. Well, mostly into large staffs. Not too popular considering how heavy they are. The glowstones in the fortress are of exceptionally high quality, however, so I was able to craft that. It has a simple wind spell inside that I made as a test.” Her voice dropped to a hushed whisper as she leaned over, tickling Arkk’s ear with her breath. “Nothing impressive to any initiate with the basics of magic down. More than enough to floor some backwoods bumpkins.”

Arkk opened his mouth, about to object to her insult. Keeper of the Heart of Fortress Al-Mir though he might be, he had still started out here with the rest of Langleey Village. Before he could, however, Zullie pulled away to chase down Hale, grabbing the younger girl by the shoulders.

“Not you. You stay.”

“But John wanted me back by—”

“You really want to go back to…” Zullie started waving her hand in a circular motion, grasping for a word. “Peasanty things,” she settled on, “instead of learning magic?”

Hale’s eyes widened. After a quick glance at Arkk, who just sighed, she looked back to Zullie and offered a hesitant, “No?”

“No, you don’t want to learn magic?”

“No! I meant no to the other thing. But John…”

“I’m sure he would be happy to know that you’re moving up in the world, not bound and tethered to this… slovenly place.”

Hale crossed her arms, pouting a pout that said she didn’t understand the word but still understood that she had been insulted. She didn’t get much of a chance to continue her pout, however, as Zullie reached out and grabbed her head.

“Open, tongue out,” Zullie said, pinching the sides of Hale’s cheeks.

“Wha—”

“Chin up,” Zullie said, lightly tapping Hale’s chin closed. “Look at my eyes.”

“Bwah—”

Hale, now trying to shove Zullie’s hands off her face, squeaked in surprise as Zullie leaned over and started peering into her ear. With a slight grunt, Hale squirmed out of her grip. “Can you read?” Zullie asked, undaunted by the look on the twin-tailed girl.

“A few words,” Hale grumbled, rubbing her cheeks.

“We’ll work on that too. Now, sit and—”

“It’s late,” Arkk said. “Let her go back today and talk about it with John. There isn’t any rush given that we still need several others.” Looking at Hale, Arkk nodded his head toward the door. “Go ahead and get back to John. We’ll…  get back to you tomorrow, I guess.”

Hale nodded twice. Spring in her step, she started toward the door only to pause and switch to a more serious style of walking. She kept her hands at her side without swinging them in the slightest as she marched out of the warehouse.

“Who is John? Her father?”

“The local carpenter. Treats her like his daughter. No one knows who her actual parents are. She just showed up on the Baron’s doorstep one day as a baby.”

“Really? Odd. Or is it odd? I don’t know how these peasants work. Does that happen often?”

Arkk shrugged. “A number of us don’t have parents. Not everyone just shows up in the middle of the night but pretty much everyone in the village is missing at least one parent or, failing that, a grandparent or two.”

“Mhm. I never knew my parents.”

“Oh. Sorry?”

“Doesn’t bother me,” Zullie said, her tone as clinical as when discussing the difference between a rune and a stave. “If I knew my parents, we wouldn’t be talking now.”

“How so?”

“When the church identifies someone with the potential for spellcasting, they’re taken away as initiates. A propensity for holy magic results in an acolyte. I showed promise for the arcane and was shoved into one of the academies. If I had been left with my family…” Zullie stared after the door Hale had just vanished through, shaking her head.

“I… barely remember my parents,” Arkk said slowly. “Ilya’s mother raised me, taught me to read, and showed me that I had the capacity for magic—even if I only caused explosions at the time.”

“That is the woman you’re trying to rescue from the Duke?”

“Yeah.”

“And she knows magic?”

“I don’t think…” Arkk paused, considering the question. “Actually, I don’t know. I don’t remember ever seeing her cast a spell, either through ritual or incantation, but it is a bit strange that she knew enough about magic to identify me as a spellcaster.”

The conversation lapsed into a few moments of silence. Arkk thought about Alya and the small ritual circle she had drawn to get him to try. It was a faint memory. Something he had thought that she had come up with as a way to get his mind off his recently deceased parents. He couldn’t remember the ritual circle or even what its intention was, only that it had turned into a bright burning fireball that Alya had then used a wet rag to beat out before it could spread through their house.

She had ordered him to never try magic indoors again.

“Perhaps she would be willing to take up a position around our ritual then.”

“Maybe,” Arkk allowed. He wasn’t so sure about that. When the subject of rescuing Alya had first come up after finding Fortress Al-Mir, Ilya had mentioned something about how Alya had been living in the village to keep watch on the Cursed Forest. If that translated to keeping watch on Vezta and the [HEART], she might not be so enthusiastic. “We have to get her out of the Duke’s manor first. With everything else I tried ending up poorly, I had been hoping to use this ritual to do that. Vezta says we will be able to find allies on the other side of the portal. If we need her, then we’ll have to find another way.”

“That sounds like something for you to figure out,” Zullie said, stiffening her back. “Now, as long as  you are here…”

“What? Don’t want to use your legs to get back to the fortress?”

“I’ve done enough physical exertion for the day.”

With an amused snort, Arkk ripped both of them through space. They reappeared just outside Zullie’s room, down the hall from the library.

Vezta stepped out from the latter room the same instant that they appeared. “Master, there you are,” she said, walking closer. “I was just about to call for your attention.”

“Something wrong?”

“I have an update on the task you assigned to me,” she said, holding out the crystal ball.

Arkk leaned in, peering at the image already on display. A familiar dirt road, roughly halfway between Smilesville and Langleey. Arkk, Ilya, and Dakka had camped on it while on their way to Cliff. At the moment, there was just one small black carriage traveling along the bumpy road.

“The inquisitors are on the move.”

## 36 - Confrontation


Arkk watched via crystal ball as the inquisitors made their way through Langleey Village. Like their first visit, they stopped at the Baron’s manor and had a chat with Gert. It wasn’t a long conversation. The inquisitors didn’t even proceed beyond the entryway. After their conversation finished, the inquisitors left and headed to the church. Abbess Keena opened the door for them but, as they moved inside, Arkk noted something odd.

“I can’t position the crystal ball’s viewpoint inside the church?”

“The Abbey of the Light has a method of blocking scrying,” Zullie said in an absent tone as she flipped through the pages Vezta had made up for her.

“Not surprising,” Vezta said. “The symbols on the building indicate that it has been consecrated to at least one of the three. It is effectively a temple to them.”

Arkk tapped his foot on the ground repetitively, impatiently waiting for the three inquisitors to step outside. It was late. Just after sunset. If they were planning on spending the night, he would have to hand the scrying off to Vezta. The only reason he doubted they were staying right now was the presence of their carriage driver. The man with the wide hat was moving about the carriage, shoving oats into the mouths of the two horses. As soon as he finished, he retook his seat, reclining back against the wall of the carriage with his hat over his face.

If they were staying the night, surely they would have invited him inside too.

Sure enough, Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox soon followed Abbess Keena out of the church, the latter carrying a lit lantern to guide her way in the dimming light. The chronicler and the purifier stayed inside, unfortunately.

Abbess Keena brought the inquisitor to the empty storehouse that Zullie had been using earlier in the afternoon. Keena stayed near the door while Vrox moved about, inspecting the remnants of the ritual circles left behind.

“I wish I could hear what they are saying,” Arkk grumbled. Neither Vezta nor Zullie responded with a solution, so he just sighed. “You weren’t doing anything illegal in there, were you?”

“It was a standard aptitude test. Shouldn’t cause any real concern, although he might wonder why we were testing the villagers.”

“Is *that* illegal?”

“Not as far as I know. Of course, officially, I would be required to report any promising subjects to the church. The fact that you and that little girl were never reported is more damning for that abbess than for us, I should think.”

Arkk slowly nodded twice, then tensed. “Is Hale in danger?”

“The inquisitors are ruthless, or so I’ve heard, but they aren’t unreasonable. They aren’t going to murder her if that is what you’re worried about.” Zullie casually flipped a page in her book. “Might take her away and shove her in one of the academies. Bit of a shame for us, but I’m sure we can find other spellcasters. It’ll just take longer.”

“She won’t have a choice?”

“I wasn’t given one,” Zullie said.

Arkk tapped his fingers against the armrest of his chair several times, watching as the inquisitor knelt in front of one of the circles. As Vrox stood up, so did Arkk.

“I’m going to get her.”

“Master—”

“No. It’ll be fine,” Arkk said. “I slip in, ask Hale if she would rather go with the inquisitors or come here, and then teleport back. Ideally, nobody knows that I was even there. At least in the next few minutes.” A quarter of the village had seen him earlier while looking for Zullie.

“I wasn’t going to object,” Vezta said, clasping her hands together in front of her chest. “I was going to mention that the young girl has been here before. Allowing her the *choice* of falling into the inquisitor’s hands is less than ideal.”

“That’s…” Forcing her didn’t sit right with Arkk. Still, Vezta had a point. “I’m sure she wouldn’t choose some random people over someone she knows.”

“Very well. I shall maintain my vigil over the intruders. If you feel me reach for your attention, leave at once unless you wish to meet with them.”

Vrox had been chatty enough the first two times Arkk encountered the inquisitor. This time felt different, however. The way Vrox was moving about the village combined with how they had been lurking around Smilesville, searching through the streets for him… Not to mention the way the purifier had chased him and Zullie around just before they left Cliff.

Arkk doubted a meeting now would be quite so friendly.

Teleporting to the far end of the Langleey tunnel, Arkk climbed up the ladder and pushed the trapdoor out of the way. It wasn’t particularly well hidden but it was out of sight of the village. Unless Zullie had screwed up earlier, nobody from the village should be aware of it. As Arkk hurried across the bridge to the village proper beyond the river, he pulled a spare crystal ball to him. Vezta keeping watch was good for when he was distracted but he needed to be sure nobody would see him making his way to the home next to the carpentry shop.

The purifier and chronicler were presumably still inside the church. He couldn’t see them. The coachman was still napping under his hat. Vrox and Keena had emerged from the storehouse but weren’t walking anywhere. Instead, they were chatting with Higgens just outside the storehouse doors. Arkk wasn’t sure why the village tailor was there at this time of night. The inquisitor was probably asking about Zullie’s test earlier.

That meant he would quickly learn that Hale had been the one with the best results.

Still, they were paused for the moment. That gave him time to run along the riverbank and to the building next to the old waterwheel. Hale was inside, eating a stew with John. Arkk didn’t bother to knock, slipping inside through the narrowest gap in the door he could manage, not wanting to flood the outside with light from the hearth.

“Arkk!” John said, an easy smile on his wrinkled face despite the sudden intrusion. “Hale was just telling me that you might be taking her away from me.” His serious tone managed to inject a note of levity at the same time, making it clear that his disappointment was just a front.

He cared for Hale a great deal. The life of a backwater village’s carpenter wouldn’t lead anywhere. A spellcaster, on the other hand? Arkk well knew that a proper spellcaster could make a great deal of coin, travel the world, and generally live well. John had to know that as well.

“Unfortunately,” Arkk started slowly. “She might be leaving sooner than expected.”

The easygoing look on John’s face faded as he narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

Arkk took a breath and looked down at Hale, who had been doing her best to not look excited at Arkk’s arrival but was now struggling not to scrunch up her face in confusion. Holding out the crystal ball, Arkk focused on Vrox.

“This man is an inquisitor with the church. He is almost certainly going to be coming here later this evening. Maybe even in the next few minutes. He will *probably* want to take you away and put you in an academy. The kind of place where Zullie learned magic.”

“A real magic school? Will they teach me to read and write?”

“I… I don’t actually know,” Arkk said, wishing he had brought Zullie along to answer a few questions. “Probably? But that isn’t why I’m here now. At least not directly. If this man takes you away, you probably won’t be allowed to leave the academy for a long time. You probably won’t be coming back to Langleey anytime soon.” Arkk gave a long look at John before glancing back to Hale.

“I assume you came with an alternate option?” John asked.

“Hale comes with me first. Zullie and I can teach you magic and how to read. You’ll still be able to visit the village, though you probably won’t want to come back until after the inquisitors leave.”

“To your… castle, was it?” John said, a frown on his face. “Out in the cursed forest?”

Arkk grimaced. Of course Hale would have told him all about it. Arkk had mentioned the ruins in the cursed forest to Abbess Keena, so the inquisitors probably knew *that* much at least. “Yes, though I would appreciate it if you didn’t spread that around too much. I don’t think the inquisitors like me much. If you come with me—”

“I am.” Hale crossed her arms over her chest. “Obviously.”

“If she goes with you then *what*?” John asked, not so easily deterred.

“Well, I don’t exactly know for sure,” Arkk said, rubbing the side of his head. “I will obviously strive to keep Hale out of any conflict that might arise. The last few times the inquisitors and I met, we just sat down and talked though, so maybe nothing bad will happen at all.”

“I don’t like it.”

“You can go with her as well,” Arkk said on impulse. “I can have accommodations made in an instant.”

“Abandon the village?”

“Not abandon. Just a temporary relocation. As soon as the inquisitors leave, I don’t see any reason why you both can’t return. It’s just that they will almost certainly try to take her while they’re here. Maybe forcibly.” Once again, he should have brought Zullie along to clarify that.

Arkk’s eyes flicked to the crystal ball as Vrox started moving. At the same time, he felt that warning tug from Vezta.

“We need to decide quickly.”

“I choose Arkk,” Hale said, crossing her arms as she shot a glance at John. It wasn’t a challenging look. Rather, she was searching for approval.

Approval came in the form of a groused sigh. “I’m going with her.”

Arkk held out his hand, two gold coins appearing in it just before he uncurled his fingers palm up. “Take the coins and I’ll—”

Two heavy thunks against the door made Hale squeak. Startled, she quickly snatched one of the gold coins. John frowned but followed suit.

In an instant, they were gone. Relocated to the library with Vezta and Zullie. The crystal ball on the table went with them.

Arkk, however, stayed where he was. Vezta wouldn’t approve. He didn’t need to peek into the Fortress to tell. The constant tugs for attention were enough.

But he was curious. What did Vrox want now? Why come back to Langleey? Was this going to be something he had to worry about in the long term? Would he always have to watch his back for inquisitors chasing him down?

Arkk didn’t feel like he was in any danger. If Vrox did move to attack him, he could instantly teleport himself back to the fortress. Meeting here and now was a better option than happening across Vrox in the middle of Cliff or anywhere else where Arkk lacked the advantage of Fortress Al-Mir.

Besides that, it caught Vrox off guard. As Arkk opened the door, he watched the flicker of surprise cross Vrox’s face before the tall man steeled his expression. Abbess Keena, standing just behind and to the side of the inquisitor, didn’t do quite as good of a job at hiding her shock.

“Mister Arkk.” His lips drew back into a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “I was under the impression that a burgeoning spellcaster called this… *hovel* her home.”

“Sorry to disappoint you, Master Inquisitor. It’s just me today.”

“Not a disappointment at all. You saved me the trouble of tracking you down.” His tone was polite but Arkk could feel the threat. “Might we come in?”

It wasn’t his home. Arkk stepped aside, motioning a hand toward the table and chairs anyway.

Vrox ducked his head to fit under the door but otherwise entered the home as easily as if he owned the place. He didn’t take a seat, moving around and touching things instead; he inspected some of the woodcarving tools on one shelf and then moved to the bed where he rubbed a thick blanket between his fingers. Keena, on the other hand, ducked her head despite her shorter statue, seeming to shrink in on herself as she walked past Arkk. She quickly took a seat at the table and locked her eyes on her lap.

“I knew you were lying to me, Mister Arkk,” Vrox said, pressing his hand to the side of one of the bowls of stew. After a short hum, the tall inquisitor looked back to the gently closing door. “From the moment we met. I could smell it on you.”

“Why do you say that?”

“You were in Darkwood a few weeks ago. Defending the burg from a horde of crazed monsters. In addition to your usual cadre of orcs, you were spotted in the presence of a monster with dark violet skin and burning yellow discs against a black starfield for eyes. The horror from beyond the stars.”

“Her name is Vezta,” Arkk said. “She isn’t a horror. That makes twice that she has defended human settlements from monsters. That’s more than I can count for you or the Duke’s men.”

“The inquisitors under my command had to clean up your mess in Darkwood,” Vrox said with his smile widening. “After you fled, we arrived and removed the threat at its source.”

“So much for the ultimate defensive object,” Arkk mumbled.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.”

“I said, I hope the people of Darkwood were more appreciative of your efforts than my own.”

Vrox let out a small laugh. “Indeed. We had to decline their invitation to a victory feast. Too much to do. Too many heretics to put in the ground.”

“Me?” Arkk said, raising his eyebrows. “What did I do?”

“Mister Arkk, what do you believe is the purpose of the Inquisition?”

“I’ve… been told that you hunt down users of forbidden magic to kill them and seal away the magic. But I’ve never—”

“Spare me,” Vrox said, raising a hand. “I’ve heard every protest. Lucky for you, I don’t care that you’ve delved into forbidden magic. Only the results of that magic.”

Abbess Keena jerked her head up and looked over to Vrox with as much confusion as Arkk felt.

“I thought your job was to suppress and destroy magic.”

“It is a side-effect of our true purpose. That of keeping beings like your monster out of our world. Some still manage to get here. They are summoned by deviants or manage to force their way through on their own. We are interested in destroying the means they might use to do so. But controlling the creatures? *That* is an entirely separate interest and one within which we have made many strides.”

“You… want to control her?”

“Control or destroy. I’m not particularly picky,” Vrox said with his same bland smile. “Then find out where she came from and make sure nothing else follows her.”

Arkk drummed his fingers on his thigh, considering. He thought back to his conversation with Abbess Keena back before the goblins assaulted the village, trying to remember everything he had said to her. He knew he mentioned ruins out in the Cursed Forest, a magical artifact, and Vezta. Had he mentioned that all those were pre-Calamity? He thought he had. In that case, repeating it now wouldn’t likely reveal anything new to the inquisitor.

“I might be able to set your mind at least partially at ease. Vezta is pre-Calamity. She has been here for at least a thousand years. From the way she talks, it might be even double that. If nothing has followed her here after all that time, I doubt you have much to worry about.”

“Worry I do,” Vrox said. “Especially when the oracles point me in a direction and I find you sitting along the path. I don’t believe in coincidence, Mister Arkk.”

Arkk just sighed. So much for getting the inquisitors off his back by making a show of cooperation. “Why don’t you speak plainly and tell me what you want? Specifically, what do you want from *me*?”

Vrox turned his head, looking over Abbess Keena for a moment. “You found an artifact out in that desolate forest.” It wasn’t a question. “That artifact is what granted you control over the creature, correct?”

“I don’t *control* her. We’re working together—”

“On what?”

“She asked me to clean up some old ruins out there,” Arkk said, figuring Abbess Keena had mentioned that as well. He really wished that he had kept his mouth shut back then, but how could he have known what would happen? That had even been before he made his contract with the [HEART]. “In exchange, she has agreed to help me out. First with defending the village and, later, defending Darkwood Burg.”

“Cleaning ruins makes you worthy of devotion?”

“It’s her home.”

“And the artifact?”

“Honestly, I have no idea what it is.” Before Vrox could call him a liar again, Arkk barreled onward. “It protects the ruins. Vezta can’t interact with it herself. Thus, she requires me to help.” Vague but true.

Vrox hummed. “Very well. Then, you will hand over the artifact for examination. If it is innocuous, it will be returned to you. You will hand over the creature as well. I will not promise its return.”

“I’m going to decline on both fronts then. The artifact is part of Vezta’s home. Vezta has done nothing to harm people. I’m not going to betray that.”

“I wasn’t asking, Mister Arkk.” Vrox’s tone was polite but laced with a painful warning.

“Yeah, well, demand all you want. It won’t change my answer.”

Vrox shook his head, turning to fully face Arkk. “It is unfortunate to hear you say that, Mister Arkk,” he said, reaching into the pocket of his long coat. “I had thought you—”

Arkk didn’t stick around. He reappeared within Fortress Al-Mir’s library and immediately turned to Vezta. “What did he pull out of his pocket?”

The servant leaned over the crystal ball with a frown. “A ring. Silver with a black stone.”

“Magical?” Arkk asked, glancing between her and Zullie.

“Probably,” Zullie said with a shrug. “Can’t tell you what it might do without examining it. I can tell you that inquisitors are known for their use of a variety of holy artifacts.”

“Things that act like that magic wand you had?”

“More or less.”

Arkk nodded twice, feeling entirely justified in escaping before the inquisitor could use that artifact on him. “Keep watching him. The inquisitors know about the ‘ruins’ out here. Since we sealed off all nearby surface entrances, I hope they just wander around until they get bored and leave.”

Otherwise… Otherwise, Vrox claimed that he had killed the Keeper at Darkwood.

They might have a fight on their hands.

It was time for a strategy meeting with Vezta, Rekk’ar, and Zullie.

But first, Arkk turned to the two new guests. Hale and John stood between him, Zullie, and Vezta, right where he had dropped them off at. Hale, having been here before, didn’t look too shocked at her surroundings but John was gawking at the still sparsely populated library. He even reached out and ran his fingers along the wooden shelves.

Arkk just smiled at them. “Welcome to Fortress Al-Mir. I expect you have a few questions. Let’s find you some quarters.”

---

## 37 - A Return Home


“Does anyone have any ideas on how to avoid the effects of mind magic?”

Arkk looked around the meeting table. Vezta didn’t move in the slightest in response to his question. She simply sat with her hands clasped on the table, watching him with her unblinking eyes. Zullie, sitting across from Arkk, hummed but didn’t say anything. She glanced upward, looking to the ceiling as if she might be able to divine the answer to his question from the maze-like pattern overhead.

Rekk’ar leaned back in his chair, one elbow on the armrest while his other arm rested on the table. Arkk didn’t expect him to have any real answers, yet he was the first to speak up.

“Kill the caster.”

“True,” Zullie said. “Can’t be mind-controlled if the controller is dead.”

Arkk stared between them, lips pressed together. “I will mark that down under contingencies,” he said with a sigh. “Any other thoughts?”

“The [HEART] normally protects its master from many forms of internal magics. A fireball slamming into your face will still hurt but I believe there should be some resistance to mind-controlling magics.”

“*Normally*?” Arkk asked, glancing at Vezta.

“I am unsure if that feature is functioning with the current state of things.”

“That doesn’t help *now*. I wanted to use this guy in that ritual.” Arkk drummed his fingers on the desk. “Zullie, do you know mind magics? Maybe we can test to see if I’ll be able to resist.”

Zullie shook her head with an apologetic smile. “Mind magic is, of course, anathema.”

“So is evocation.”

“We’re taught to recognize signs of summoning as part of our training in the academies, giving me an inlet into *how* such magic functions. Identifying signs of mind magic usage falls under the dominion of those who use holy magics. I would suggest you ask your abbess or the inquisitors but I doubt that is an option, is it?”

Arkk shook his head. It certainly wasn’t an option. “If I can get a meeting with him, Vezta will come with me, hidden in my shadow. Should he manage to take control of me, you’ll have to kill him and we’ll look elsewhere for our ritual participant.”

“Speaking of,” Zullie said. “I’ve been working with Hale over the past three days. I’m not positive that she can take a corner just yet but she is a whole lot closer than… anyone else,” she said with a glance at Rekk’ar.

The orc just scoffed, unbothered by the insult.

“If she can, that would be the best option.” Arkk paused, taking a moment to peek in on his most recent employees. Both were in the newly constructed workshop. It was a full-fledged lumber mill and carpentry shop complete with tools and a large saw blade for cutting the plentiful logs. John had been quite impressed upon seeing it. “The corners are going to be harder to fill than the sides,” Arkk said, looking back to Zullie “Keep working with her.”

“Sure thing. Any idea who is going to be positioned at the last corner? Assuming you can get this gorgon guy—”

“Gorgons?” Rekk’ar growled. “I thought we were done entertaining that foolish idea.”

“I’m not sending the orcs after them,” Arkk said, shooting Zullie a glare. “The mine I told you about the other week ago is where this mind-wizard is hiding out. I think he is controlling the gorgon to use as guards. I’m not quite sure what the plan is yet. I don’t want to meet with him while the gorgon are around.”

“I would say that you just said the smartest thing I’ve heard you say but you want to meet with a man who has gorgon under his thrall.”

“He also put an entire village into some kind of stasis-like sleep,” Arkk admitted. Rekk’ar did not look impressed. “From the scrying I’ve done on the mine, he mostly stays down on the lower levels while the gorgon lurk around the entrance. They venture out to bring him food—mostly rats and fungus—but otherwise stay well within the mine unless intruders venture too close. I’m… honestly hoping I can appeal to him through his stomach. I’ll toss in a nice roasted chicken from Larry along with a message requesting we meet peacefully.”

“Should use your instant movement magic to appear in his private quarters and drag him out,” Rekk’ar grumbled.

Arkk nodded. “I thought about that. Don’t want to startle him. Considering I need his help, antagonizing him on our first meeting sounds like another downside.”

“In my former master’s day, spellcasters would typically ward against such teleportation magics. Teleporting in despite that generally ends poorly for the one attempting it. There is no obvious way to identify a warded area before attempting the teleportation unless you locate the anchor stone, which can be fairly easily hidden.”

“That’s another reason,” Arkk said. Vezta had explained that before to him when he had asked about getting into the Duke’s manor that way. Her words now were for the benefit of others at the table. “Given teleportation magic is High Anathema,” he said with a nod toward Zullie, “I’m not sure how many people will be—”

Arkk froze as he felt a sharp tug on the employee link between him and Ilya. He let out a small sigh as he looked in at her location. She wasn’t in trouble. Rather, she was standing around outside a garrison. It took him a moment to recognize the spot.

“Ilya’s in Smilesville,” he said, a genuine smile forming on his face. Standing, he looked over the others. “Meeting adjourned. Keep an eye on the inquisitors,” Arkk said to Vezta. “And everyone, try to think of a good plan for avoiding gorgon or mind magic.”

Arkk didn’t wait for any responses. He disappeared from the meeting room and reappeared at the far end of the Smilesville tunnel. The inquisitors, he knew, had left Langleey and headed back toward Cliff. He doubted they would be gone for long but for the moment, he should be safe to walk around Smilesville without worrying about them popping up.

The tunnel’s exit let Arkk out a short distance away from the burg’s walls. Most of the burg’s farmlands were down by the river on the floodplain. There was a small forest-covered hill just behind the village. That forest hid the trap exit. People did come up into the forest for foraging, hunting, and lumber, but nobody had found the door so far. It helped that it was hidden underneath a layer of dirt and brush that he had to lift to get out.

From the exit, it took a little over ten minutes to reach the burg’s gate. Nobody stopped him. He had been a little worried that the inquisitors would have put a bounty on his head. So far, there was no sign of that. After another few minutes of walking through the town, Arkk reached Ilya.

She was a beautiful mess. With how long she had been out on the road, Arkk wasn’t surprised to see her looking worn down, tired, and covered in a smear of grime. Her silvery hair wasn’t as smooth and straight as usual. Tied up into a tight ponytail to keep it out of the way, it was still frayed and frazzled. Her clothing looked worn and in need of replacement.

“—put a bounty out on any slavers!”

Still, watching her argue with the same archivist that Arkk had spoken with the last time he had been here, Arkk’s heart swelled. He rushed right up to her and wrapped her in a tight hug.

She jolted, shocked and ready to fight him off until she realized who he was. “Arkk! How did you… Where—”

“Welcome back, Ilya. You stink.”

“Arkk,” Ilya growled. “Get off me.”

“I haven’t seen you in over a month and that is how you treat me?” Arkk said, affecting his tone with false hurt as he pulled away. “I take it you didn’t succeed in finding a tailor?”

“They were all dead,” Ilya said, voice a whisper. “Or kidnapped. We found two on the way back but they didn’t know where they had been taken or what happened to any others. I’ve been trying to put bounties on slavers at every burg we’ve passed. Only one or two even listen to me,” she said with a glare at the archivist. “Only one would take a down payment of gold and Olatt’an thinks he took it for himself.”

Arkk had no idea how bounties got instantiated. He glanced at the archivist, who was pointedly ignoring them despite their presence right in front of her desk. “Don’t worry about the gold,” he said.

“I’m not. I’m worried about the bastards who attacked the elves.”

“I’ll speak with the archivist,” Arkk said, hoping their few interactions would be enough of a rapport to get an honest answer about how to place bounties. Otherwise, he might have to ask Hawkwood about it the next time he was in Cliff. “For now, however, why don’t we get you and the others back to the fortress? We’ll—”

“That’s another thing,” Ilya said, shoving a scrap of parchment against his chest. “What is the meaning of this?”

Raising an eyebrow, Arkk looked down. The first thing he noticed was the large symbol dominating the top half of the parchment. A familiar symbol. It was a depiction of an eye with a vertical bar instead of a pupil, split several times by thin horizontal lines. The inquisitors wore the same symbol as a metal pin on their uniforms.

Feeling his stomach dropping, he quickly scanned over the rest of the parchment. “A recruitment notice? To scour the Cursed Forest for old ruins?” He looked over to the archivist. “How long has this been posted? When is this search taking place?”

The woman adjusted her glasses. Still ignoring Ilya—making Arkk wonder if half her troubles in placing a bounty came from her sharp ears—the archivist looked at the parchment in Arkk’s hands. “Swiftwings delivered notices to all burgs in the area over the last few days. We just received the notice last night. The search parties will gather in Stone Hearth Burg in ten days’ time where Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox will organize them and send them into the Cursed Forest. Unfortunately, we do not have many more details than that. If you are interested in signing up—”

“I might be,” Arkk lied. “I need to speak with my men first.”

“Very good, sir,” the archivist said, immediately looking back to her desk.

“And I think I need to speak with them immediately,” Arkk said, placing a hand on Ilya’s elbow as he led her away from the garrison. “Let’s get you and the others back. The two elves with you are coming as well?”

“I didn’t know what else to do with them,” she said with a sigh. “Sorry if that—”

“It’s fine. The fortress is more than large enough for two hundred more, let alone two more.” Although they were now moving down the street toward the stayover, far from others, Arkk dropped his voice to the barest whisper possible. “They aren’t employees so I can’t just take them straight there, unfortunately. Are they opposed to joining up?”

“I didn’t talk with them about that. They barely speak at all. I was just… trying to keep a level head as we made our way back. I kept wanting to run off into the wilderness and track down these slavers myself. Olatt’an kept me moving in the right direction.”

“I’ll see about these bounties. Maybe tracking them down ourselves won’t be impossible. We’ve got a lot going on right now, however. A lot has happened while you’ve been out. Not much of it good.”

“Great. Just what I wanted to hear upon returning.”

“Would you like to hear about a hot bath? I’m having the lesser servants stoke the flames as we speak.”

Letting out a faint sigh, Ilya nodded. “*That*, I could stand to hear some more about.”

“Great. Try not to worry too much about things for at least a little while. We’ll talk about what you did and what I did after you get some good food and some rest. Nothing that has happened is immediately urgent.” Arkk pressed his lips together, looking back down at the parchment in his hands. “Well, nothing except this maybe.”

“Piss off some people while I was gone?”

“To be fair, I think they were pissed off before they got here. I didn’t do anything to make the situation better, though.”

Ilya paused in the middle of the road, making Arkk stop as well. The garrison sat right on the edge of the city, close to the wall and one of the city gates. “We’re not actually at the stayover,” she said, nodding her head toward the gate. “Olatt’an claims he wouldn’t be welcome in any burg in the Kingdom and a few of the others are in similar situations. I especially didn’t want them around *here* after what we saw when passing through with Dakka.”

Arkk’s jaw tightened. “They did take those bodies down. Probably a good idea anyway.” Using his employee vision, he did a quick check on Olatt’an and the other orcs Ilya had taken with her. Like her, they all looked worn and ready for a nap. If the inquisitors were sending people into the Cursed Forest in search of him, he needed them well-rested and ready to fight if the situation called for it.

He would have transported them all straight into Fortress Al-Mir from here were it not for the two smaller elves that were sitting in the middle of the group. A young boy and a young girl. Siblings, maybe? They both had hair the color of gold and the same upward tilt to their sharp ears.

“What is the deal with the elves?”

“As I said, the village was destroyed. Many died. Many more were taken as slaves. Those two, we found on our way back in the hands of some old human,” Ilya said, her fists clenching tight. She paused, not speaking for a long few moments until they passed through the gate and left the burg behind. Only then did she resume in a soft whisper. “The orcs were more than happy to fight his guards and smash in his head. They looted his manor. I only took the kids.”

“Did… anyone see you?”

“No one still alive,” Ilya said with a frown. “Don’t know exactly what happened to the kids. They don’t speak much. Any time I or one of the orcs raise our voices, they flinch. I’m hoping a safe environment will help, but we… sort of left that village behind in a hurry. Doubt our hasty retreat helped much considering they were slung over orcs' shoulders most of the way. It must have felt like they were being kidnapped all over again.”

Arkk… didn’t quite know what to say to that. “Hale is living at the fortress for now,” he said. “Learning magic from Zullie. Maybe having someone around who is their age—or at least height—will help. John is there as well. You know how he dotes on Hale.”

“That is a relief. I have no idea what to do. They want to go learn how to hunt, I can do that. Parental things?” Ilya shook her head and then pointed off the road.

Following her lead, they quickly came across the orc camp. Although it wasn’t a camp. Rather a small gathering. They hadn’t set up their tent or even started a fire. Most of the orcs were gathered around, sitting on the ground or a fallen log while a few others kept watch. At Arkk’s approach, one of the guards called back for Olatt’an.

The old orc stood and approached slowly. He looked a bit resigned to having a chat right out here in the middle of the woods. Before he could start, Arkk waved him off.

“You all want to get back. We’ll have a debriefing later. Unless there are any objections, I’ll send you all back now. Make sure you have your belongings.”

Arkk waited a moment. Although he hadn’t specified, all the orcs ready to go lined up in front of him with a pair holding onto the horses’ harnesses. The horses and carts, considered property of his, could be transported as well although they were reaching the upper limit of what he was able to move. As the rest gathered their things, they slowly formed into a messy gathering as well. Then, once everyone was standing in front of him, he pulled them back to the Fortress. Everyone except Ilya and the two young elves stayed behind.

The two elves didn’t look up or react to the sudden disappearance of the orcs. They just stood stock-still, not even looking up to meet Arkk’s eyes.

Arkk shot a glance at Ilya but she had no eyes for him. She stepped forward, pausing when the smaller elves flinched. “This man is going to give you a coin,” she said. “It is yours to keep. It will let him take you to a safe place. Do you understand me?”

Both gave identical nods of their heads, still without glancing up. Neither said a word, though he did note that the young boy started breathing harder as Arkk stepped closer. Trying to look as unthreatening as possible, Arkk pulled out a pair of gold coins. Kneeling, he got a look at their faces for the first time.

While partially healed, there was heavy evidence of bruising. The girl’s eye looked like it might have swollen up recently, though now it had at least partially returned to normal. One of the boy’s ears had been clipped, chopping off a sizable portion.

Not trusting himself to open his mouth, he just held out the gold coins.

“Take them,” Ilya said, noting their hesitation.

That stopped their hesitation. Arkk didn’t miss the stricken expression crossing the girl’s face as she took the coin like it was a venomous snake. The boy held it like he wasn’t sure if he wanted to throw it away or hand it right back.

Arkk couldn’t quite understand their expressions. He did start frowning as he noted something.

“It didn’t work.”

Both winced, squeezing their eyes shut in preparation for a beating.

“What do you mean?” Ilya hissed, tearing her eyes off the elves.

“I mean it didn’t work,” Arkk said, keeping his voice as soft as possible. “There isn’t a connection.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know,” he said, thinking back to all the other times he had hired employees.

Ilya had been his first, becoming an employee upon them making a transactional agreement. The orcs, he had hired with gold. At least some of them had been under duress at the time with him threatening them into working for him. So duress couldn’t be it. He had been able to hire Hale without incident, so age didn’t play a factor.

Then there were all the times he had handed gold over to people *without* hiring them. Mostly merchants. Whatever magic linked him to his employees could tell the difference between purchasing goods or services and a desire to hire. At least to an extent, given Ilya’s hiring.

Was it his fault? Did he not want to hire them? He wanted them back at Fortress Al-Mir. Wasn’t that enough? Or was it something else? Did the magic, apparently smart enough to not hire merchants, think that these kids weren’t worthy of working for him? Was it something about them? A resistance to wanting to work for him? He doubted that it was the falsehood of what Ilya said given that he had hired Ilya basically on accident, maybe her words played some role anyway?

“I might need to ask Vezta.”

“We can’t just leave them here while you go figure things out,” Ilya hissed. “Can we… I don’t know, *carry* them? You move our clothes and gear. Why not people?”

“We can try. Otherwise, the entrance to the tunnel isn’t far from here. The tunnel isn’t designed for people to physically travel through—” Not after Zullie’s excursion to Langleey, anyway. “—but it is a direct route straight to the fortress.”

“Let’s try the instant travel first. Not looking forward to walking in a dark tunnel. My boots have practically worn away as it is.” Stepping back toward the smaller elves, she held out her arms for the young boy. “Come here. I’m going to pick you up and *hopefully* we’ll disappear.”

Although he winced at Ilya’s arms, the young elf didn’t disobey. He stoically marched over and let Ilya pick him up without a fight. Ilya lifted him off the ground but didn’t fully stand. Probably not wanting to drop the elf if one disappeared but not the other.

With Ilya’s arms around the young elf, however, Arkk noted something interesting. A link formed between him and the boy. It wasn’t an employee bond. Not like he had with all his other employees. Some elements were similar but, if Arkk had to put a word to it, it would be *prisoner*.

Although he hoped it wasn’t permanent, it did afford him the ability to pick up and drop both Ilya and the elf in her arms back at the fortress.

The prisoner bond solidified somewhat upon their arrival, making him worry a bit more.

He needed to speak with Vezta.

But first, he looked down at the remaining elf. Instead of staring at the ground, she stared after her vanished brother with wide eyes and a quivering lip.

“We’re not going to hurt you,” Arkk said, kneeling and holding out his arms as Ilya had. “Come here and you’ll be back with him.”

The young girl had teal eyes, Arkk noted as the elf threw an angry glare his way. That flash of defiance disappeared almost as quickly as it had come as the elf dropped her head and stepped into Arkk’s arms.

Both vanished.

## 38 - The Ruins of Fortress Al-Mir


“Master Arkk. Might I ask why you’re out here?”

Arkk glanced back. He wasn’t quite sure how Vezta found him. To the best of his knowledge, the employee link was one-way. He could look in on his employees at any time but the reverse was not true. Then again, the link he had with Vezta was slightly different than what he had with everyone else. Well, everyone except his two prisoners.

And wasn’t that a topic.

He didn’t want the two elves working for him. They didn’t want to work either. Thus, an employee bond couldn’t form. Instead, upon being ‘captured’ in his and Ilya’s grips, they had become prisoners. A similar status to an employee in that he could see them but he couldn’t move them on their own, only in the grip of one of his employees. Or himself. They didn’t contribute to the magical power of the [HEART] the way his employees did and they couldn’t open doors on their own. They were…

Prisoners.

Even though Arkk didn’t really want that either.

Shoving the thought aside—he had enough on his plate at the moment to worry about investigating the strange magic of the [HEART]—he looked back to the newly constructed tunnel.

“Working on a project,” Arkk said.

“There are several wings of Fortress Al-Mir that are going unused. Making an entirely new wing and so far from the rest of the fortress is entirely unnecessary.”

“Ah, but it can *only* be far away. It would defeat the purpose if I started this little construction project closer to the Heart.”

All twelve of the lesser servants were scurrying about, moving their pulsating and vile bodies against the dirt walls, eating them away to extend tunnels and carve out rooms. Some of them followed along behind the others, claiming territory by stamping down those compass-rose tiles with the glowstones in the center. Arkk followed after *those* ones, pulling gold from the treasury to place down rooms in every corridor and newly constructed room.

The appearance of the tiles didn’t change too much. The stone cracked. Bits and pieces disappeared entirely. Spider webs formed in corners and an unpleasant musk filled the air. He had gotten used to it.

Vezta wrinkled her nose, running her hand along the wall. Bits of the wall crumbled away under her touch. Dust clung to her fingertips.

“You call this construction? The schematic you are using is faulty. Where did you discover it?”

“Asked Zullie. She said she doubted that she would be able to make a more advanced room on her own but the work she did with you on the temple gave her enough of an idea of how to do *this*. And this is exactly what I intended,” Arkk added, kicking a small bit of rubble off to the side of the corridor.

“You intend to deface Fortress Al-Mir with such shoddy work? This looks like…” Vezta trailed off, eyes narrowing as her golden suns turned on Arkk. “This looks worse than the dilapidated fortress at Darkwood.”

“Exactly!” Arkk spread his arms wide, spending gold to ruin this new section of the fortress. “Inquisitor Vrox wants to find ruins? He’ll find ruins.”

“A decoy?” Vezta said, frowning at one of the torch-holders dropping its torch as the new schematic overwrote the pristine wall.

“If he can’t find anything, he’ll expand his search. Don’t want him to expand it to the point where he discovers the trap doors. So, we give him a little something. Hopefully what he *expects* to see. I did some scrying on the Darkwood fortress. Not much left. Looks more like dirt tunnels than how this fortress did when I first arrived, but I did copy the layout here.”

“They likely killed the [HEART]’s Keeper and sent the [HEART] into dormancy,” Vezta said, her tone pained. “Fortress Al-Mir was merely lacking a master when you found it.”

“Well, we don’t want that to happen here, do we?”

“No.”

“Hence the ruins,” Arkk said.

Vezta knelt, plucking a cracked glowstone from the floor. That might have normally destroyed the magic of the room but, since the room *was* a cracked and withered version of the regular tile, the *actual* tile was underneath, shrouded in magic. Or so Arkk guessed from everything he knew.

“You went to Zullie for help with this schematic?”

Arkk hesitated at her question. She spoke with the same pristine calm that she normally used. Something about the way she stared at the glowstone without any of her eyes flicking up to him made him think there was more to the question than the surface words would indicate.

She… wasn’t jealous, was she?

“The idea came to me after I went to bed last night. Following yesterday’s meeting, I couldn’t sleep much. Too busy thinking.” He shook his head, moving on. “I woke up early and thought to find you. When I did, you were in the temple room. I’m not sure if you were meditating or praying. I didn’t want to disturb you.”

“I exist to serve Fortress Al-Mir and its master.”

“That doesn’t mean you have to do everything. You can take a break too. Zullie was awake—I’m not sure living underground is good for her; it seems like she has no sense of a sleep schedule—and I asked her. As I said, making a more advanced room would have likely been beyond her capabilities.” Arkk motioned to one broken-down wall. “This wasn’t.”

Vezta stayed staring at the glowstone for a long moment before it fell from her fingers. Clasping her hands together in front of her navel, she stood and nodded. “I understand your reasoning. Please don’t fear disturbing me in the future.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. “If it makes you feel better, I will need your help with some other rooms. First, let me tell you the rest of my plan.

“I’ll dig a few access points to the surface and scatter around some debris. Nothing *too* obvious, but enough to draw attention. Might have the orcs stomp around to make it look like the entrances are in use too.”

“We draw them in and bombard them with traps? Collapse the entrances around them and trap them inside? Collapse the entire wing on top of their heads?”

Arkk stared for a long moment, surprised at the hostility in her voice. “I… was thinking more along the lines of *letting* them destroy it.”

“*Master*…”

“This wing, I mean. Not the whole fortress. This is what I need your help with. I want to make a fake Heart. We put up a token resistance but eventually let them in. They destroy the fake heart. We decommission the whole wing then, collapsing parts of it until they start running away. The inquisitors leave, thinking they’ve finished their objective. The main Fortress Al-Mir is unaffected and we carry on as usual… except you and I need to take care not to be seen around the area. Maybe we go on a road trip to the other side of the duchy to make them think we’re starting a new base of operations out there.”

Vezta drew in a deep breath, looking around with a frown. “That might work. They might come back later once they realize the extent of your duplicity.”

“Hopefully we have the portal open and the Pantheon’s help by then. Or whatever is on the other side.” Vezta had tried to explain a few times but… it felt like one of those things that had to be seen to really comprehend.

“We’re just buying time then. I understand. You would need to make at least some parts of this place look lived-in. The inquisitors are aware that you have several orcs working for you.”

“Good point,” Arkk said, looking through his plan for the new wing in his mind’s eye. “We’ll have a few proper rooms closer to one of the entrances. A dormitory, kitchens… Maybe a library if it will generate books on its own the way Zullie’s bedroom did. Otherwise, I don’t want to lose our books.”

“We’ll have to adjust them to look more worn down to match the aesthetics you have in the rest of this place.”

“Adjusting existing schematics shouldn’t be too hard, right?”

Vezta shook her head. “I shall get started on the task immediately.”

“Thanks. I appreciate it.”

Vezta dipped her head, bowing. She started to turn away, only to pause and look back. “As servant, advisory isn’t my forte—”

“Just say it, Vezta.”

“The fortress requires contiguous territory. Some small tunnel must connect this place to the real [HEART] if you wish for your ploy to succeed. That introduces a vulnerability to the real [HEART].”

Arkk frowned. He had been planning on collapsing the main tunnel he had used to build this wing far to the north of the actual fortress. The fact that it would all fall apart if he did so had slipped his mind. “Any suggestions?”

“My former master had a method of hiding passages. Doors that were indistinguishable from walls. I do not know how to create such defenses.”

Arkk didn’t think that was very useful to point out if it couldn’t be done. He didn’t voice his thoughts, however. “What about smaller tunnels? When the lesser servants dug out to find the Darkwood fortress, their tunnels were much smaller,” he said, holding his fingertips together in a circular manner. “Too small for people, but large enough to count for contiguous territory.”

“As long as they are large enough for the servants to claim the area, that might work.”

“We could put several of the tunnels around in every room. Have a few loop around on themselves, others lead to nowhere. Only one would be a real tunnel. Even if they found a way to investigate the holes in the walls, they surely wouldn’t investigate them *all*. All could be filled with grates to deter any exploration if they do find a way.”

“Still a vulnerability. I suppose that cannot be eliminated with this plan. Very well. I shall consider other complications and deliver my thoughts on the matter when I deliver the altered schematics.”

“Sounds good. I’m going to keep working here. Do you want a quick transport back?”

“To the library, if it isn’t too much trouble.”

It wasn’t any trouble at all. With a thought, Vezta disappeared.

***

Arkk peered into the crystal ball on his table, frowning at what he saw within. The mines of Silver City were maze-like and expansive, containing even more ground than Fortress Al-Mir. The network of tunnels followed the veins of ore—silver, which was where the settlement got its name, but also lead and copper. Tools, carts, shoes, and hats had all been left behind. Most looked untouched but the gorgon in the caverns had taken an interest in some of it.

Watching the gorgon was a strange experience. The Smilesville garrison had a small treatise on various beastmen and demihuman races. Their writings on the subject of gorgon left much to be desired, unfortunately. It seemed as if gorgon were rare enough that there wasn’t much information about them. Or perhaps few people made it back from an encounter alive. What was known was little more than what Hawkwood had mentioned back in Cliff. The serpentine beastmen had coils strong enough to crush even hardened steel, they had glands in their upper mouth that allowed them to project a kind of venomous acid from their fangs, and their gaze could turn someone to stone.

Their most infamous ability was on full display inside the mine. Not all the miners had made it out when they moved in. Detailed statues of fearful humans stood around the tunnels, silently watching forevermore. Arkk had been somewhat nervous about scrying on them, not sure if looking at their visages would turn him to stone even through the crystal ball.

That particular bit of magic required direct eye contact. Thankfully. 

They also looked at the so-called Hope Killer without ill effect, implying that it took an active choice to turn someone to stone rather than passively turning everything they saw to stone.

Arkk wasn’t sure how much Savren was controlling them. When he wasn’t in their vicinity, they went about their day as normal. Mostly spending the time lounging about or eating—Arkk had discovered that they could undo their stone transformation, returning petrified persons and animals to their fleshy forms for consumption, which made their infamous ability far more practical as a hunting tool than Arkk had initially thought. From his morbid observations, he decided they liked animals—mostly rats, though he wouldn’t be surprised if they would turn to the frozen humans if they got too hungry—and ate nothing in the way of grain, fungus, or fruit.

Which made Savren’s consumption of the latter items curious. The mind magic he used must have made them ignore it.

Some of them had to go hunting for Savren. They brought back vermin for the most part. Sometimes one or two would venture out of the mines for fruit or mushrooms foraged from the nearby forest. From the way they moved within the mines and the way they moved outside, Arkk doubted they enjoyed those tasks much. It was almost like they were frightened of the open air.

Savren himself spent most of his days deep within the mines. He avoided the gorgon for the most part, choosing to isolate himself with a shelf full of books. Arkk tried to peer over his shoulder and glean what the man was reading but he flipped through the pages so fast that Arkk barely had time to read a few sentences. He couldn’t tell if the man was actually reading or just skimming through in search of something. The only clear thing was that the books delved into mind-affecting magics.

That was the biggest problem point. Even more so than the gorgon. So far, his only plan for dealing with that possibility was bringing along Vezta and hoping that her killing the man would remove any spells.

He might not have much of a choice. According to Zullie, people capable of fulfilling the corner spots of their ritual didn’t grow on trees. The ones that did exist would almost certainly have been swept up by the academies and would be both harder to access and less willing to help. His only real choices were criminals like Savren or unknowns like Hale. While the latter was more appealing, he didn’t know how to go about finding such people beyond testing every single person he came across.

Savren, though less appealing from a purely moral standpoint, was at least a known quantity already.

Known quantities could be planned around to an extent.

He just wished he had a better plan.

“Vezta, are you ready?”

“Master,” Vezta said, standing from the table, “is it wise to leave the fortress at this time?”

“We have eight days before the inquisitor commences his search. The new wing is almost finished. There isn’t much we can do here besides sit around and twiddle our thumbs. If this works, we get someone else who might help defend should the inquisitor find the real fortress.”

“And if it doesn’t?”

“We escape and we’re back where we started except we know not to waste our time on Savren.”

“And leaving a trail of magic circles for them to follow?”

Arkk waved his arms around the dilapidated fortress. “That’s the beauty of doing this here. We *want* them to discover this place. If they don’t stumble across them, great. If they do, great! No matter what, we win.” Arkk reached down to the table and adjusted the basket. It contained bread, fruit, and fresh meat. A peace offering. Or bribe. He had some raw poultry dangling from ropes tied to their ankles in the hopes that throwing them at the gorgon would make them less likely to try to eat him.

The raw poultry had a little surprise with it as well. He wasn’t sure that it would work but he was willing to try just about anything at this point.

Vezta walked over to a clear section of the floor and, after a short scrying session, used her tendrils to scrawl out a teleportation circle. “Very well,” she said. “I shall protect you as best I am able.”

“That is all I ask. Let’s go.”

## 39 - Silver City


Silver City did not live up to its name. It wasn’t silver, though Arkk hadn’t expected it to be. It wasn’t a city either. Barely larger than Smilesville Burg, Silver City lacked walls, expansive farmland, a stayover, and even a church. Nestled against the wrong side of a mountain, the moist smell of mildew permeated every one of the tightly-packed homes and storage warehouses.

Despite the state of the mine putting the miners out of work, the settlement was still populated. It might have been better had the people scattered to the winds. Everywhere Arkk looked, people were downtrodden, covered in filth, and gaunt. The latter issue was all the more apparent in the children that roamed the streets. Their bony arms and knobby knees reminded Arkk of a famine that had hit Langleey in his youth. They had managed to get some help from Smilesville.

The Baron of this village probably traded the goods from the mine for the bulk of their food. The farmland was too small to support this place on its own. Fewer farms meant more people working the mines. As long as they had goods to trade, the more miners they could get, the better.

Normally. Without the goods from the mines, their survival would rely on altruism from the nearby settlements.

And it didn’t look like anyone was helping here. Certainly not the Duke with his droves of taxed food and goods. With the air chilly and winter setting in, it would only get worse.

Arkk and Vezta on their own would have drawn plenty of looks. Vezta especially. She wasn’t bothering to hide most of her inhuman nature, having donned a cloak but was still walking in the open with her dark violet skin and a multitude of moving eyes set about her body. Despite that, Arkk was pretty sure the villagers gathering in their wake were far more interested in the chickens hanging from his and Vezta’s shoulders.

“Maybe we should have taken one more teleportation circle directly to the mine entrance,” he whispered to Vezta. “All the scrying I did and I never thought to scry on the actual village. Maybe we should give them our food and come back with more for the mines?”

“The meager food we carry is intended for eight gorgon and one human. All we would accomplish is starting a riot as the have-nots attack those who would receive our gift.”

“Then—”

“Fortress Al-Mir’s hatchery is far too small to support a population of this size. While it is possible to expand, it wouldn’t be up and running for some time. We only have a few days before the inquisitors arrive. If you wish to delay…”

“No,” Arkk said, firming his shoulders as took his gaze off the gathering villagers. “But I might ask that Savren send the gorgon away before we leave. That will do more good for the village than a few chickens.”

“A wise decision.”

“I am a little surprised they aren’t trying to attack us.”

“Curiosity and wariness hold them at bay. Curious about our presence and intentions with the food. Wary of me.”

Arkk blinked and glanced to his side.

He started, jolting as he realized Vezta wasn’t just not bothering to hide but actively flaunting her inhuman nature. Outside the comforts and privacy of Fortress Al-Mir, she normally formed proper legs from the mass that made up her body. Not today. A large mass covered the ground underneath her cloak with several tendrils clawing forward. They roiled about, moving in an unnatural undulation that he found difficult to look at and difficult to turn away from at the same time.

He forced himself anyway, focusing his gaze on the far end of the village where the mine entrance was located.

They didn’t make it much further before a trio rushed toward them. A shorter man who reminded him of Baron Freede except this man had clearly had to tighten his belt over the past few months. The way his fine clothes hung loose made Arkk wince, wishing there were more he could do. The other two were here as guards. They were probably militia, gathered up from some of the local miners.

The newcomers stopped a respectful distance away, eyes on Vezta.

“Heard you had a gorgon problem,” Arkk said, deciding to speak first. He didn’t want to waste time while they hummed and hawed over Vezta. “I’m Arkk, the leader of Company Al-Mir. Here to take a look and see what we’re dealing with.”

“A free company? You’re answering our request for help?” The apparent leader of the group sounded like he could hardly believe his ears. He turned his head away from Vezta though couldn’t quite take his eyes off her for another few seconds. Eventually, after blinking several times, he looked at Arkk. “A few adventurers came by a month ago… they were the only ones.”

“I assume they weren’t very effective.”

“Didn’t come back.”

Arkk nodded, expecting that answer. “Well, I can’t promise anything.”

“I… understand. We didn’t think…” The man looked around, loose skin trailing just behind the rest of his face as he met the eyes of the villagers. “The poultry you have, is that—”

“For the gorgon. Not something you would want to eat. Trust me.”

“Poisoned?” he asked with a frown. A few of the crowd let out despairing moans at hearing that. Some even started wandering away. “We tried that in the early days. The damn snakes can smell it or something. They didn’t touch anything we left out for them.”

“Not exactly poison, but…” Arkk considered. “I guess we’ll see if it works.”

The man shrugged, then turned away from Arkk. “I am Geno. Baron of Silver City. The mine is just this way,” he said, motioning before walking. “The gorgon only come out at night. We can approach without harm during the day. Stepping even a single foot inside is… perilous.”

Arkk had already seen the results. There were five or six statues just inside. He had seen it during his scrying. “I notice you don’t have any walls,” Arkk said as he walked alongside the older man. “Is the silver not a valuable target for bandits and raiders?”

Geno smiled and raised an arm to the mountain. “The steep natural walls protect us here. burgs Meddale and Stirling Waters block the way through the valley, protecting us from that side. No problem we couldn’t deal with ever reached our town.” He paused and looked back. “Until the gorgon.”

“The burgs can’t help with the food situation?”

“Some of our people already fled to them, putting a strain on their resources. They still helped out… until a few weeks ago. The…” The Baron wrung his hands, shooting a look around. “Duke Woldair’s taxmen collected their due. There isn’t enough left for all of us. I don’t know how we’re going to get through the winter, even if you do get rid of the gorgon.”

Arkk’s hand clenched into tight fists around the handles of the wicker basket he carried. He could hear the creaking under his hands.

“I… I don’t want to say this,” he started, pausing and turning fully. “When the taxmen came here… they took our silver. We can’t offer what we originally posted on the bounty boards.” He held up his hands, fear crossing his face as his mind came up with all kinds of terrible scenarios. “But we can still pay. If the mines are safe, we can start working again. We’ll pay double. It’ll just be over time. If you could just—”

Arkk wished he could hold up a hand of his own to stop the man’s diatribe. Hands busy, all he could do was rudely interrupt. “Why don’t we see if we can clear out the mines before we worry about payment? No sense getting ahead of ourselves.”

“Oh.” Geno looked surprised for a moment. His shoulders slumped after. “Oh.”

Not sure what part of that the Baron was worried about, Arkk simply kept walking, moving past the older man. “Probably best if you stay back from here. The mine is just across the creek, isn’t it? We can find it ourselves.”

“I… Good luck.”

“Appreciated,” Arkk said, giving the man a small smile as he and Vezta started up the worn path to the mine. Turning to Vezta, he asked, “Thoughts?”

“The man must be desperate if he is ignoring me.”

“Doesn’t want to question his good fortune at having someone show up.”

“I think he is nervous about what you’ll ask for if you do manage to clear out the mines. The way he reacted makes me think he believes you will ask for the whole village. Maybe you should.”

“What would I do with a whole village? I’ve already got the fortress.”

“You wouldn’t be able to claim the territory at this time, not officially, but the people would still be yours. The [HEART]’s power increases with every minion added. My former master counted a hundred thousand as his minions and the magic he could wield would put the lightning spell that impressed you so to shame.”

“I still don’t know what I would *do* with the village. I’ve got enough on my plate already.”

“If that is your desire.”

“For now at least,” Arkk mumbled, thinking about it more. Maybe being the baron of a village would get him in the good graces of the Duke. At least enough to get him in the door to see Alya.

He shook his head.

“We’re here,” he said, slowing to a stop as the path leveled out. A short distance away, a gaping hole in the mountainside opened up, supported with thick wooden beams. He didn’t see any movement around the entrance, which was probably a good thing.

Setting down the basket of food, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a thick strip of cloth. Wrapping it around his eyes and pulling it tight, ensuring not even a little light got in, Arkk shifted his view. While his eyes were blind, he could still see himself and Vezta using the fortress’ power. The perspective wasn’t that great, offering a view of himself from somewhere overhead, but it was better than being turned to stone.

Vezta handed over the chickens she had been carrying. Accepting them was a bit clumsy. As was bending to pick up the basket once again. Taking a few steps, he staggered, feeling like he was going to tip straight over onto his side.

“You should have practiced more.”

“It’s fine,” Arkk said, steadying himself. “It’s as simple as putting one foot in front of the other.”

Vezta shrugged. Her tendrils reached up around her, ripping and tearing through her as they pulled her into Arkk’s shadow. A few glowing yellow eyes appeared in the darkness under his feet before they winked out one by one.

“Remember, eyes closed. If I start panicking, just start attacking everything around me.”

Vezta didn’t respond in her shadow form.

Moving carefully at first, Arkk crossed the rest of the way to the mouth of the mine. Through his Keeper vision, he spotted the statues standing around the entrance. Five of them, all looking inward yet frozen with fear on their faces. They had been there ever since the first time he had scried on the mines. They had likely been left in place as a warning to anyone else approaching.

Quite an effective warning.

The Baron had said that anyone stepping inside would be attacked. He had already guessed that would be the case. There was always one gorgon on watch at the entrance. Usually the smallest one, though they did rotate through all eight of the snake-like creatures.

Arkk stopped at the threshold.

“Hello,” he called out. “Anyone home?”

Not every beastman could speak or understand human languages. Sometimes, their mouths or throats just weren’t set up for it or they just never were taught in the first place. Those that couldn’t typically stayed on their own, remaining in their communities away from humans and demihumans. Gorgons typically stuck to themselves, but he wasn’t sure if they could speak. Their faces looked humanoid *enough*, yet snakelike at the same time. It was a bit confusing. Like a cross between a demihuman and a beastman.

He was hoping that Savren could somehow hear through them with his magic, listening to Arkk shouting.

“I’m here in peace with food aplenty,” Arkk said, lowering the basket. The chickens looped over his shoulder were tied together at the legs, leaving them dangling from a string. He shrugged one off and flung it inside. “I know there is a human in there,” he said. “I just want to have a chat with the human down in the lower levels.”

Movement in the shadows beyond the mouth of the mine made him tense, ready to signal Vezta at the first sign of hostility.

Although the creature had black scales, as it slithered forward into the light, it took on an iridescent rainbow barely visible against the dark coloration. Larger, horizontally oriented scales covered its belly and underside. They were a bit of a lighter color, though still dark enough to mesh well with the rest of its body.

It had a wide hood spread out behind its head and neck, making it look wider than it really was. A normal snake might not have much distinction between its neck and the rest of its body. Gorgon, however, were partially humanoid. They had shoulders and arms and four-fingered hands.

The human-snake face lost all illusion of humanity the moment it opened its mouth. It let out a long hissing noise as its dark tongue snapped out, tasting the air.

Arkk kept his feet planted where they were, trying not to shake as it drew itself up until it was a full three heads taller than him. The smallest of the gorgon would tower over an orc like that. He was glad they didn’t have one of the larger ones guarding the entrance. It was still far enough away that Vezta couldn’t attack it. Unless he had severely misunderstood how gorgon petrification worked, it couldn’t attack him either.

That was the only reason he hadn’t turned and run.

“Hello,” he tried again, shrugging off another pair of chickens. These, he just held out. “I come in peace with gifts of food.”

The treatise he had bought from the Darkwood alchemist, Morford, contained only the simplest of concoctions. One of which had been labeled as a Drought of Rest. Arkk had tested a little on himself. It wasn’t a sleeping potion but it did make him calmer and in a state where he could get an easier night’s sleep.

Arkk was hoping the gorgon would be a bit less interested in attacking him with that in their systems.

Assuming they didn’t smell it and view it as poison like the local baron suggested they might.

The gorgon hissed again.

Then it spoke a wispy, hissing speech.

“Leave, human, or join your brotherss and ssissterss in ssilence,” it said, waving toward the statues around the entrance.

“I would love to, believe me,” Arkk said, starting to gain a little confidence. He would *much* rather talk than fight. It talking was a *great* sign. Maybe something would go right for once. “I just need to talk to the human here first. If he doesn’t want to come up, I wrote him a note here in this gift basket,” Arkk said, slowly lowering himself to grab the bit of parchment he had written out earlier.

“Human? There iss no human here.”

Arkk blinked behind his blindfold and looked up. He couldn’t see the gorgon through his eyes but the surprised reaction still followed through. “Down on the lower levels. You bring him food once a day while he sits and reads his books. You, the green one, and the orange one visit him most.”

“Vissit?” The snake’s slit-pupil eyes didn’t blink the way a human’s might. The protective shield that winked over them still made it look confused in a very human-like way. “Ssavren demands tribute. He iss the only one I offer food to. There iss no human here.”

“Yes! Savren. He…” Arkk trailed off, frowning as the wheels in his mind turned. Savren was a human. He had seen it through scrying and he had confirmed it through the bounty on the Hope Killer. The wheels clicked into place once Arkk thought a moment longer about the type of magic he specialized in. “He isn’t mind-controlling you. He makes you think he is a gorgon as well.”

“You—”

“This is going to sound weird,” Arkk said, interrupting. He pulled the crystal ball out from his pouch and held it out toward the gorgon. The image in the ball changed as he did so, showing the private quarters Savren had made out of one of the chambers on the lower levels. “Could you look into this and tell me what you see? No tricks. I don’t even have a sword.”

The gorgon slithered closer. Some primal part of Arkk’s mind wanted to run off. He clamped it down and locked his legs in place.

“A human,” the gorgon said, dismissively.

“Does it look familiar at all?”

“You all look the ssame.”

Arkk blinked behind his blindfold again and slowly shook his head. “I meant the room. His surroundings.”

The gorgon stretched its head forward again, peering down into the crystal ball for longer than before. Arkk couldn’t read a single expression on its face but he *did* note the expression change a few times.

“What iss thiss?”

Arkk was *pretty* sure it sounded upset. Maybe even angry.

He took a slow step back that the gorgon barely seemed to notice.

The gorgon turned away from him, slithering deeper into the mine without another word.

“Wait, where are you going?” Arkk said, stepping forward once again. He even crossed the threshold of the mine but the gorgon did not turn back as it raced inside. “Wait!”

Vezta extracted herself from his shadow, slowly opening only the eyes on her face as she looked at him. “Master,” she said, “was it your intention to get our spellcaster killed?”

Arkk didn’t entertain her with a response. He grit his teeth, staring after the gorgon as his mind raced to find a way to fix the situation or at least turn it to his advantage.

Gnawing on his lip, he picked up his gifts and stepped forward, moving deeper into the mine.

## 40 - The Mines of Silver City


“Is this a good idea, Master?”

As used to Vezta as Arkk was, he still jolted at the way Vezta formed a mouth on one of the tendrils that emerged from the shadow around him. It moved with him, just appearing out of the ground. With his blindfold still in place, he only saw it through his employee sight. That only made it all the eerier, watching as it seemed to slide along the ground, inhuman maw facing him.

Despite being unnerved, he put on a smile. “I trust you to keep the gorgon away should they attack.”

The tendril sighed, an odd mannerism from the fleshy limb, and then retreated into the shadows.

“I do have a quick question though,” Arkk said, not pausing as he hurried after the gorgon. He stumbled a bit, tripping over rocks that he couldn’t see. Glowstones in the cave let him see where he was going now that they weren’t being washed out by the daylight outside but the *perspective* with which he saw occluded the ground directly in front of him. It took a bit of care not to fall on his face. “At Darkwood, several different monsters were working together for that enemy Keeper. Including a monster that I was assured would never work alongside its own kind. Is there something about the Heart that… encourages cooperation, for lack of a better term?”

“As far as I understand it,” Vezta said, tendril emerging once again, “the [HEART] does not impose any mental magic like what we suspected this spellcaster to be capable of. If someone with a bond intends to attack you, the bond will be broken immediately.”

“And that bond doesn’t falter between employees no matter their intentions,” Arkk mumbled to himself, thinking back to the times the orcs tried attacking one another. “Do you have any explanation for the cooperation of the Darkwood ghasts?”

The tendril shook in a way that Arkk recognized as a negative. “Perhaps being bound to the same entity instilled a sense of comradery that the creatures normally lack? Why do you ask, if I may?”

“Just trying to figure out how best to use *everything* to our advantage,” Arkk said, falling silent as the long tunnel opened up into a much wider cavern. Wooden planks laid out in the tunnel provided extra footing. More wood had been brought in here, anchored to the walls as a rickety staircase that descended into the mine.

The gorgon he had been chasing after didn’t traverse the stairs as easily as the relatively flat tunnel, giving Arkk plenty of time to catch up.

“Wait!”

The gorgon turned its head upward.

Arkk felt something. A tingle in his fingertips and toes. For an instant, he feared he miscalculated with the blindfold. The feeling didn’t progress. A quick check of his hand showed no sign of stone. Shrugging the sensation off as nerves, he turned his head down to fully meet with the gorgon below. “What are you going to do?”

“If the human valuess itss life, the human would leave before drawing the attention of my den.”

“I need to speak with that human,” Arkk said.

“The den won’t allow *that* human to live after desseiving uss.”

“Yes, well, how are you going to convince your den that he’s a human? You open that door and I bet he looks like a snake again. It is your word against his and your den’s eyes.”

That comment got the gorgon to narrow its eyes.

“The human is a powerful spellcaster,” Arkk continued. “He put an entire human settlement into some kind of sleep that they haven’t woken from even after months. Who knows what he might do if he thinks you all are turning on him.”

“Thiss iss a matter for *uss*. What iss your sstake, human?”

“He is a powerful spellcaster,” Arkk said. “I’m conducting a ritual that requires many powerful spellcasters, so I would prefer if you didn’t try to kill him. Also, I’m sure people would be very happy if he would undo whatever spell he put over that human village I mentioned.”

“None matterss to uss.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. “I suppose I should have expected that.”

The gorgon turned away, resuming its slow trek down the stairs. Arkk continued after it. “Hold on, you still have to convince the other—”

A loud hissing noise cut Arkk off. It didn’t come from the gorgon he was following but rather from one of the large tunnels branching out into the walls at the bottom of the stairs. He froze, though the other gorgon did not.

The green-scaled gorgon emerged from the tunnel. Larger than the black one with a more masculine frame, it *rushed* straight to the stairs in a move that made Arkk take a few steps back up. It didn’t rush up the stairs, thankfully, but rather stopped at the black gorgon. They engaged in a rapid series of hissing along with undulating movements of their tails that must have had some kind of meaning. Arkk didn’t understand any of it.

“If they start attacking, collapse the stairs below me?” he mumbled, watching from above.

Vezta didn’t respond verbally but Arkk noted dark tendrils emerging from the shadows to wrap around several of the stairs ahead of him.

As the two gorgon spoke—or communicated—more started emerging from the same tunnel the green one had passed through. In short order, Arkk was pretty sure all of the mine’s eight gorgon were gathered down below, sporting a variety of colors. Green, red and black, yellowy orange, and brown. Only about half of them were actively participating in the argument. The others had taken up positions slithering back and forth at the base of the stairs, waiting for the command to surge upward.

Something the iridescent black gorgon said gave even the ones passively listening pause. It pointed up toward Arkk before swinging its arm over to another tunnel that, from his scrying, Arkk knew led down to where Savren had taken up residence. It then held out its hands, making a spherical motion. Arkk presumed it was talking about the crystal ball.

The deep viridescent snake turned its head upward, aiming emerald green eyes at Arkk. “Human,” it said, voice deeper than Arkk expected yet still maintaining that breathy quality that the iridescent snake had. “Sshow us of what sshe sspeakss.”

“The crystal ball?” Arkk didn’t need to turn his head to look around with the way he was seeing the area. He did so anyway. If the way the snakes had been moving while talking was any indication, body language was important for the gorgon. “What assurances do I have that you won’t attack me if I go down there?”

The viridescent snake drew itself up a little higher. “None.”

“Oh. Well, that’s inviting,” Arkk mumbled. “Do you think you can take on all eight at once?”

He felt something squirming up his back. Warm breath tickled his ear as Vezta spoke from just behind his shoulder. “With my eyes closed, I can do little but thrash wildly.”

“Is that a yes or a no?”

“It’s an ‘I wish my master wouldn’t be so foolish as to descend into the gorgon den.’”

“Since you aren’t protesting more, I’ll take that as a yes,” Arkk said. Louder, he called down to the gathered gorgon. “Alright. I brought gifts. I know you all have been eating rats and I can’t imagine they’re very appealing, so please, enjoy these chickens,” he said, leaving the basket behind so that he could hold the chicken out. The basket was for Savren anyway with its fruits, vegetables, and bread. “And if you don’t attack me, I could probably get more,” he added, descending.

Reaching the bottom, the four that had been slithering back and forth didn’t rush him. He took that as a good sign. Holding the chicken out brought them a little closer, obviously wary. Their tongues kept darting out, licking the air around him. One with an orange diamond pattern down its back snatched a pair of chickens from him as he slowly walked forward. It tasted the air around the chicken in its hands for a long moment before opening its mouth *far* too wide. Snapping the string that kept the two chickens attached, it reared its head back and shoved the entire bird down its throat, whole. Larry had plucked them before Arkk left but he wondered if that would have even mattered as he watched the snake’s throat visibly constrict and pull the chicken further down into its long body.

None of the others came for the chicken. While Arkk watched in a disgusted fascination that he couldn’t quite look away from, the other gorgon watched as well though with a different purpose, maybe expecting the orange one to keel over from poison.

After a moment, it settled down on its coils, making a noise. An odd buzzing noise. Almost like a cat purring, but not quite as… soothing. Still, it seemed to be a noise of contentment.

Another gorgon picked up the discarded chicken and began the same air-tasting process before it too decided to eat it whole. That broke the tension over the rest. All except the black and green snakes quickly relieved Arkk of his gifts. There was a whole chicken for each of them. That left him holding one pair, which he held out as he approached the two remaining snakes.

The black one accepted it, snapping the string tying the chickens together before handing the spare over. The green gorgon didn’t take it, however, staring over Arkk. It left the black one behind, circling Arkk while its tongue darted out of its mouth.

“I’m not here to be enemies,” Arkk said, speaking with as much confidence as he could muster. The gorgon accepting his offerings helped bolster his confidence quite a bit. It would help even more if that Drought of Rest he had soaked them in actually worked. “In fact, now that I know the situation here isn’t what I expected, I think—”

“You ssmell of the sstarss,” the green gorgon hissed as it came to a stop a little too close for comfort.

Arkk licked his dry lips. It could smell Vezta? “Is that a good thing or a bad thing?”

“That remainss to be sseen.”

Ever since he had been a child, he had quizzed *everyone* who came to Langleey Village on every topic he could think of. While that impulse had died out a little as he got older, it hadn’t died completely. None had mentioned *stars* until just the other week ago. The inquisitors had mentioned an unusual smell around him as well. Unable to help his curiosity, Arkk *had* to ask, “What do stars smell like, anyway?”

The green snake’s tongue shot out into the air again, wiggling up and down for a few seconds before snapping back into its mouth. It turned away without answering, returning to the iridescent black snake. It took a lot longer to taste the air around the final remaining chicken than any of the others had taken but still eventually ate it, shoving the whole thing down its throat.

Arkk let out a small sigh of relief. He wasn’t sure if the contentment the others were showing off was from his alchemical solution to this problem or if they were just happy to have a large good meal. Either way, it couldn’t be bad for him.

“Anyway, yes. The other person here is a human, not a gorgon. He’s a master of mind-affecting magics which is probably why you don’t think he is human.” Arkk slowly, not wanting to make any startling moves, reached down into his pouch and retrieved the crystal ball once again. He probably should have asked the first gorgon if it knew what a crystal ball was and how it worked but it seemed to work out. “So, here we are,” he said, showing off the large room they were in. “And if we move the view down that tunnel over there…”

Several of the gorgon gathered around, peering into the crystal ball. Figuring the green gorgon was the leader given that it was the one who ordered him down here to show this off and was the last to eat the chicken, Arkk tried to pay them little mind as he focused his attention forward. Even still, when he moved the view of the crystal ball into Savren’s quarters, he *felt* the tension in the air spike.

“This man is Savren. A human criminal wanted for putting an entire village to sleep. We thought he was controlling your minds but it seems as if he has merely been posing as a gorgon.”

“The room,” the black gorgon said, pointing a finger at the crystal ball. “You can ssee the bookss. The chair. We’ve sseen the room and yet itss a *human*.”

“The ball sshowss liess.”

“It’s just a crystal ball,” Arkk said, feeling a little nervous as a smattering of hissing began from the others around. “If you know how to use one, you can try it yourself without me.”

“We confront Ssavren,” the black gorgon said. “Reveal which human iss desseiving uss.”

“Ssavren is not to be disturbed.”

The black gorgon let out a long, irritated hiss.

“Why?” Arkk cut in before a fight could break out. The way they immediately turned their heads toward him made him think it was a bad idea. Too late now. “Why? If I’ve assembled my timeline correctly, he came here between a few weeks and a month after you all moved in. He isn’t your leader, is he? If he is, *how* did he become your leader?”

Perhaps there was more mind magic going on than he had thought.

“When exactly did Savren first appear? Why did you start turning to him, following his commands to bring him food and water? He never leaves his quarters, does he? How often do you *actually* see him?”

Arkk’s questioning seemed to stall the green-scaled gorgon. He could almost see the wheels turning in its mind.

“We will dissturb Ssavren.”

“As soon as you open the door, he’s going to look like a gorgon again.”

Arkk wasn’t sure how he was pulling off his mental magics. A lengthy incantation probably wouldn’t be fast enough. Perhaps he had some ritual circle prepared that he only needed to flood with magic or maybe he was using a magic wand to store his spell. However it was, Arkk doubted that simply opening the door would cause his ploy to fail.

“Let me talk to him,” Arkk said. “I have no weapons on me. If he is a gorgon, he’ll be able to crush me in an instant and you all can go back to your lives. If he isn’t, I can handle him myself. And then…” Arkk trailed off, glancing around. “Then I might have a proposition for you all.”

“More food?” a red and black striped gorgon asked.

“As much as you can eat,” Arkk said. “In a safe location.”

“We are ssafe here.”

“Are you?” Arkk asked, cocking his head. “You might not know this, but the humans that used to work here have a large amount of silver that they are offering to an army that can kill you all.”

It wasn’t exactly a lie but the wording got the intended effect. The gorgon started hissing at one another. Although sedate after having fed, they were getting riled up.

“Can we fight an army?”

“It doessn’t matter. Ssavren will sslaughter the human.”

“The army will sstill be there whether or not thiss human diess.”

“We’ll be punisshed if the human intrudess. Kill it now.”

“I alwayss thought Ssavren acted sstrangely…”

“We sshould confront Ssavren oursselvess. The human cannot be trussted.”

“Ssilence!” The green gorgon slithered around, moving back and forth among the others. “Who ssuggesstss we sslaughter the human now?”

Arkk tensed, looking around through his Keeper sight. He let out a small sigh of relief as only two of the gorgon slithered forward in response. One orange and one brown snake. The latter looked around as if expecting others to join it, giving another brown gorgon a look of betrayal as it did so.

“It promissed food.”

“The human liess.”

“No lie,” Arkk said. “I have a safe, underground home with as much chicken as you could stuff yourselves wit—”

“The human will remain *ssilent*,” the green gorgon said, coming a little close for comfort. “You will live. For now.” Backing away, it turned back to the rest of the assembled gorgon. “Who would have the human sspeak for uss in front of Ssavren?”

Arkk looked around again, wincing as he noted not a single one of the gorgon moving.

His plan to get Savren out of here wasn’t looking too good at the moment.

“Who would confront Ssavren oursselvess?”

This time, only one of the gorgon remained behind. The orange gorgon who had first come forward for chicken. The same gorgon who had expressed fear over Savren punishing them and one of the two who had just voted to kill Arkk.

“A conssenssuss hass been reached. We sshall confront Ssavren and ask for proof.”

“He is a mind-affecting spellcaster. He could—”

“*Ssilence*.”

Arkk stepped back as the green gorgon got in his face once again. He could see the shadows underneath him twisting, reading themselves to attack. The gorgon didn’t, however, choosing instead to just stick out its tongue once again.

“You ssmell far too confident for your possition, human of the sstars.”

“I don’t feel all that confident,” Arkk mumbled, mind racing as he tried to figure out a way to salvage at least some of this trip.

“Ssavren or the human liess. We will kill the liar.”

If the gorgon killed Savren, he would have to look elsewhere for a spellcaster and he had absolutely no other leads. Vezta could probably stop them but that put both of them at risk. All it would take would be a little bite from one of them to kill. Arkk wasn’t sure if Vezta could survive that with her unique physiology but *he* certainly couldn’t. Besides, if he could get the gorgon to Fortress Al-Mir, it would help on a few different fronts. First, they were strong and powerful enough that their mere presence made mercenary companies wary of venturing in here. Second, if the inquisitors *did* find their way into the main fortress, a glance from their petrifying gaze would put an end to that incursion.

Third, he would gain renown. Single-handedly saving Silver City from destruction by clearing out their mines? Doing a job entire mercenary companies were afraid of on his own? Even dragging a kicking-and-screaming daughter of a viscount back wouldn’t be worth as much as saving a whole city.

Then, if he *could* convince Savren to undo whatever he had done to the village of Hope, that would be a *second* settlement saved in the same fell swoop. That was in addition to his participation in the ritual.

If the Duke refused to invite Company Al-Mir to a party after saving two whole cities, nothing would get him in.

Now, it looked like at least half of those things were going to crumble to pieces, if not all of them. The gorgon were slithering away, heading for the tunnel that led down to Savren’s quarters. There, they would likely kill him or he would convince them to kill Arkk.

“Wait!” Arkk called, stepping after them. His mind raced, trying to come up with *something* to say to convince them of *anything*.

A black and red gorgon turned and hissed at him but Arkk kept walking, looking at the green-scaled one. It was the leader here.

What did the gorgon want? As a collective, safety and food. Was there more than that? Revenge against the human deceiver in their midst—whoever they ended up deciding that would be. There had to be more. What kind of hopes and dreams did they have? What could Arkk offer them?

Gold didn’t seem all that useful for the gorgon. It was a human and demihuman currency. They didn’t interact with humans at all. What else? Books? They hadn’t thought it was strange for Savren to be reading books. Could they learn magic? Would they want to?

If he could show them Fortress Al-Mir, let them create their living quarters, see the hatcheries, and even browse the library, would that help?

Arkk, running after the snakes with his blindfold in place, missed a step and stumbled down a sudden slope in the passage. He swung his arms about, trying to regain his balance before slamming into the floor—or worse, slamming into one of the gorgon.

A tendril, stretching out from the shadows, caught him.

As he felt his balance return, he looked around. The gorgon had paused their advance down the tunnel, attention pulled by his flailing and possibly a yelp he had made upon first stumbling.

One of the gorgon came up to him, the orange one that had voted to kill him earlier. It raised its arm and opened its mouth wide with its fangs extended.

“Vezta.”

A dark tendril swept around him. It wasn’t the precise attack that Arkk was used to. It still smacked into the gorgon, flinging it against one of the walls. Three more tendrils emerged from the shadows, wiggling with hostile intent around him.

He thought for just a moment that the others would rush in and attack all at once.

They didn’t.

With all eyes on him, Arkk tensed. This was his moment to say something. Possibly his last words before they confronted Savren. Maybe his last words period. He stared for a long moment, mind racing until the wheels clicked together. Looking at the gorgon’s eyes through his Keeper vision reminded him of something Dakka had said back in Cliff City.

These gorgon didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect some human coming into their den, upsetting the balance of things, bringing gifts and sniveling like a coward.

Arkk took a breath and reached up behind his head. He tugged at the blindfold around his eyes. Focusing on his ire at the situation, at all he was working toward nearly coming to failure once again, and at the thought of finally getting things working in his direction for once.

Letting the strip of cloth fall from his eyes, Arkk stared at the ground for a moment before raising his gaze to meet with the potentially deadly eyes of the snakes around him. As he did so, a bright red light flooded the corridor, coming from *him*.

*Glowing eyes are an ominous omen*, Dakka had said.

Arkk, tendrils wiggling around him, turned his head slowly and made sure everyone saw his eyes. “I said, *wait*.”

## 41 - Mesmeratic Magic


“You know, I come in here with gifts. I try to be nice. I explain what is going on…”

Arkk looked over the gorgon, feeling strangely calm. Stupid. Yes. He had his eyes open, staring at creatures that could turn him to stone with eye contact. Still, the tranquility running under the surface managed to suppress the instinct to flee in fear. Maybe his calmness came from the fact that he probably wouldn’t even know what hit him if they decided to attack. Vezta would surely go on a rampage. At that point, Arkk wouldn’t be in much of a position to worry or care.

Either this worked or it wasn’t his problem anymore. That thought was strangely freeing.

He had the *full* attention of the gorgon now. Were glowing eyes that big of a deal? It was true that when that purifier had been chasing him and Zullie around the Cliff Academy’s tunnels, he had found the glowing embers of her eyes unnerving. To command the attention of creatures entire mercenary companies wanted to avoid with just a look?

Arkk might have to be even more careful in the future to not let people he didn’t want to know see his eyes like this.

“I know you’re upset. Or if you aren’t yet, you will be if you manage to see through Savren’s illusions.” Arkk paused, looking around as if daring them to petrify him. “But I need him alive. I’m willing to offer food and shelter in exchange. Maybe more than that. Meaningful work. Magical tomes. Other things you might want. Or you can walk away.” Arkk paused, looking downward at the nearest gorgon. “Or… slither away. Or you can even stay here, though the threat of an oncoming army of humans is looming on the horizon.

“But I need him alive.”

The orange gorgon that Vezta had knocked aside said something in an elongated hissing noise. Arkk made sure not to look directly at it, feeling like that was the most likely gorgon to try to turn him to stone at this moment, but he still caught its movements in the corner of his eye. From the way it looked at Arkk and bared its fangs once again, it was probably something like ‘Kill the human!’

Vezta’s tendril sliced through the air in front of it. If she wasn’t keeping her eyes closed, she probably would have taken its head off. As it was, the swipe passed just in front of its snout, making it stop its advance before it could begin.

Arkk didn’t flinch, trusting Vezta to keep it at bay. He settled his gaze on the green gorgon, putting as much intent into his gaze as possible. He had suffered too many setbacks, too many failures. He wasn’t going to falter again without a fight.

“So. What will it be? Take my offerings? Walk away? I don’t mind if you confront him as long as he stays alive.”

A smattering of hissing started up around him. From their earlier voting, it seemed like they would go with whatever the majority decided, not whatever the green one said. Still, it had been the spokesperson—spokes snake?—so far, so Arkk didn’t look away.

The hissed dialog of the other snakes petered out after a few seconds. The green snake hadn’t joined in, choosing to stare back.

Eventually, it spoke.

“Sstarss…”

Arkk quirked an eyebrow. The tight grip of his fist loosened as he stared with a little less determination and a little more confusion. “Excuse me?”

“The human sspeakss with the power of the ancientss,” the green gorgon said. “Ssavren iss a traitor and desseiver.”

“You… believe me now. Just like that?”

“The *ssirkessh* honor the old wayss,” the green snake said, bowing its head.

Arkk blinked twice, watching as several of the others also ducked their heads. The orange one that had attacked Arkk didn’t. Neither did the brown one that had also voted to kill him. The iridescent black gorgon looked around in what Arkk assumed was confusion as did a red and black gorgon. The other four were practically bowing—or whatever the equivalent was for beings that lacked a defined waist.

“Vezta,” Arkk whispered. “What’s going on?”

“In my former master’s days, snakelike beings lived in the [UNDERWORLD],” Vezta whispered into Arkk’s ear. “Keepers brought them over to this plane. These gorgon must be descendants of the beings I once knew. I presume they remember their ancestral allegiances.”

“Half of them do,” Arkk said, looking to the four who hadn’t bowed down. “Is there a proper response to this?”

“That would have been my former master’s domain of expertise, not mine. I suggest you make minions of them as soon as possible to prevent them from changing their minds and backstabbing you without warning.”

Arkk took a breath and slowly walked forward, ending up even more encircled by the gathering of gorgon in the narrow tunnel. “You wish to join me?” he said, louder than the tone he used with Vezta.

The orange one protested immediately, hissing out an obvious objection despite Arkk’s inability to understand exactly what it was saying.

The green gorgon raised its head, glaring at its fellow gorgon as it let out a furious response. Whatever it said, it was clear that *everyone* was shocked. The other three bowing their heads jerked their heads up to stare at their leader and the three not bowing recoiled slightly. The wide hood around the orange gorgon’s head thinned, pulling in on itself as it seemed to shrink in size.

Before Arkk could ask, the green gorgon turned back to Arkk. “Disscord,” it hissed. “You will confront Ssavren. If Ssavren sslaughterss you, you are unworthy.”

“And I can take him if he doesn’t kill me?”

“We sshall align oursselvess in the interesst of the old wayss.”

Arkk nodded his head. “Acceptable terms.”

“Then come. We sshall deliver you to Ssavren.”

The green-scaled gorgon turned away, slithering ahead down the tunnel. After a slight hesitation, Arkk followed. The other seven gorgon trailed behind, hissing among themselves quietly. Arkk didn’t say a word, moving with full confidence as he descended another staircase.

This was it. He wasn’t quite sure exactly what happened. Something about either his eyes or Vezta’s tendrils had given him an advantage here. It had gotten him what he wanted. He wasn’t about to let this advantage slip away.

The chamber Savren called his home wasn’t far from the second set of stairs. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what the original intention of the room had been. A resting room, presumably, given its beds and the attached latrine. The door wasn’t meant to keep anything out. It was more for privacy.

The green gorgon stopped outside the door, standing off to the side. It dipped its head again as it motioned to the door.

“Vezta,” Arkk said softly, “hide again unless you sense something wrong with me.” Taking a breath, Arkk closed his eyes and let go of the feelings he had been concentrating on. When he opened them again, he was pleased to note a distinct lack of ruby light reflected off the walls of the mine.

With Vezta’s tendrils retracted for now, Arkk stepped up to the door, pushed it open, and stepped inside.

The largest gorgon Arkk had ever seen sat in a chair with a book open in its five-fingered hand. It was a bit strange to see a gorgon sitting in a chair. The way its long, snake-like tail bent at the ‘knee’ and then just flopped across the room looked incredibly awkward. Rather than a hood behind its head, this gorgon had a hard crest rising from the vibrant blue scales around its eyes, forming into a ridged structure with sharp points at the middle and either side.

The pale blue eyes—which lacked slit pupils—slowly tore away from the book to look up at Arkk.

Something immediately hit Arkk as he met the creature’s eyes. A sensation of fear and awe nearly drove him to stumble back out of the room. Pressure at his back—a tendril under his shirt—kept him in place.

“What is thiss?” Savren hissed, rising off the chair. “I’ve not humored any humans for dinner in a handful of moonss.”

Arkk closed his eyes, taking a brief moment to look at the area through the third-person perspective provided by the employee link with Vezta. When he did so, the illusion shattered. A greasy old man with black, unkempt hair who hadn’t had a bath in months stood at the chair. Not a gorgon.

When Arkk opened his eyes, the gorgon was there once again along with the sensation of awe. The fear of it wasn’t.

“Hello, Savren. Or should I call you the Hope Killer?”

The false gorgon blinked. A slight flinch. “What wearisome waste is this? Why have the others allowed a human into my miness?”

“That awe effect is something interesting. It must be why the other gorgon haven’t noticed that you don’t even elongate your s-sounds properly.”

The gorgon’s lips twisted in a distinctly human sneer. Not the kind of expression Arkk thought the others would be able to make. When his eyes looked up over Arkk’s shoulder, Arkk did a quick check behind him using his Keeper sight. Three gorgon stood in the opening. The green one, the black one, and the brown one. “Khan, Zharja, Vezz. What is the meaning of thiss? Do you deign to disregard my directions not to be disturbed.” Savren turned away, setting his book on top of his desk to the side of a small stack of thick tomes. “Dereliction of duty. Dispose of this dunce then return for your disciplining.”

“Turn me to stone,” Arkk said, stepping further into the room.

Savren whipped his head back. “What?”

“You’re a gorgon. Turn me to stone.”

The gorgon form of Savren shifted in a distinctly humanlike movement of discomfort. “You don’t know what you ask, human. Petrification is a poor penalty, death is preferable. Your body freezes but your faculties still function. You don’t see, you don’t feel, you just *think* until you succumb to the senseless situation.”

“Not sure why you care. I’m just a human. Go on. Turn me to stone. I won’t blink or look away. Do it. *If you can*.”

The gorgon’s jaw slid to one side and Arkk heard a very *human* set of teeth grinding together. “I have no time for this. Khan, dispose of this human. Now.”

Behind Arkk’s back, Arkk watched the three gorgon look at each other. He couldn’t quite read their expressions but if he were to make a guess, he would guess they were a bit angry. Even the orange one, despite its anger at Arkk, looked none too pleased with the actions of their so-called leader.

“I think that is one item checked off my list,” Arkk said, taking his eyes off Savren to look around the room. “How are you maintaining this illusion? A hidden ritual circle somewhere? Or maybe—”

“*You*… *Lumpuhkan yang di depanku*—”

“*Electro Deus*.”

A thin bolt of weak lightning jumped from Arkk’s fingertips to the large gorgon before he could get his incantation off the ground. It wasn’t a powerful bolt. It was still enough to send Savren to his hands and knees.

And he had knees now. Arkk couldn’t guess whether the illusion required mental concentration or if he had an item on his person that the lightning bolt had damaged. Either way, a *human* knelt on the ground in front of him, panting. He spat a bit of blood out of his mouth, having bit his tongue from the jolt.

“We have sseen enough,” the green gorgon hissed from behind Arkk.

Savren’s head snapped up. He looked down at his grime-coated robes before looking back up with fear in his eyes. “You *fool*. They’ll kill us both!”

Arkk just slowly shook his head. He looked back over his shoulder.

“The ssirkessh will join you,” the lead gorgon said, dipping its head once again. The other two gorgon dipped their heads as well, though not quite as reverently. The black gorgon still looked confused while the orange one maintained a faint glare.

“You would follow a human?” Savren shouted, disbelief filling his tone.

“We follow the wayss of the sstarss.”

As soon as the gorgon spoke, Arkk felt it. Eight new employee links forming. No exchange of gold necessary. It was more like when Ilya had accidentally joined up as his employee. A bit strange but not something he was going to question. He simply nodded to the gorgon. “Gather up what belongings you might have. We’ll leave these mines as soon as I’m done dealing with Savren.”

“You need him alive,” the green gorgon said—Khan, if Savren had their names right. “We can sstone him if you wissh and return him to normal ssome other time.”

Arkk turned back to Savren as the man let out a long squeaking noise. “I’ll think about it. Let me talk with him first.”

“We undersstand.”

“Wait,” Arkk said before they could slither away. “The humans at the entrance. You can unpetrify them?”

The black gorgon—Zharja—exchanged a look with Khan. “It may be more merssiful to ssmash the sstatuess.”

Arkk shook his head. “Are there other petrified humans in the mines?”

“A ssmall number.”

“Gather them up at the entrance, please. Wait to unpetrify them until I’m ready.”

Khan ducked his head. “We obey.”

Arkk opened his mouth, about to complain about the gorgon’s mannerisms. He got enough subservience from Vezta. Something held his tongue, however. He wasn’t quite sure what their perspective of him was, exactly, but he didn’t want to damage that perspective right now while the situation was still precarious. There would be time to talk to them normally later, once they were all at Fortress Al-Mir.

Instead, he let them slither away.

Turning back to the room, Arkk stepped past Savren, moving to the stack of books. Flipping open one, he looked through a few pages. Mind magic rituals. Mass rituals. Rituals that were intended to affect a large number of people.

Something like what he did at the village of Hope, then.

Movement at his back had him turning.

Savren was trussed up, held by a tentacle at each limb and around his waist. A long, thick rod of knotted wood with a green glowstone attached to the tip fell from his fingers as Vezta’s tendrils twisted his arm. He let out a few pained gasps before she stopped.

“Wha—What are you?”

Arkk stared at him. Blinking his eyes, he welled up his feelings of irritation, making a red light return to the room. “I’m not in the mood,” Arkk said. “I came down here with a gift basket for you in an attempt to appease you. I don’t think I’m going to give you a choice now, however.”

“A choice—gah!”

“Vezta, it’s okay. Come out, would you?”

A few stray tendrils turned into the shadows under Arkk’s feet, reaching inside. They ripped Vezta’s main body out of the darkness, bringing her out into the open. She still managed to maintain her hold over Savren even as she moved about.

“I was already pretty upset with you after I heard what you did to Hope. I was going to try to convince you to undo that over time. Ease you into things. The way you acted just now kind of pissed me off and I was already a bit on edge from dealing with the gorgon. Hope was bad enough but at least they aren’t dead. Do you have any guilt over ordering the death of some random human who had done you no wrong?”

“You were jeopardizing my—” He cut himself off as one of Vezta’s tendrils started worming its way around his throat.

Arkk didn’t bother admonishing her. Instead, he just bent and picked up the large staff that Savren had pointed at him. It was too large to have come from his clothes. It must have been leaning against the wall. He looked it over, wondering what kind of spell it contained. “Maybe I’m just taking it a little personally because it was me,” he said with a small shake of his head. “So here is the deal. You are coming with me. You can do so as a mostly free man or as a prisoner. We are preparing for a large ritual. You will help with it. This is not negotiable. Whether or not I have a use for you after the ritual depends on how cooperative you are. Understand?”

Savren didn’t speak. He did nod his head.

“Good. So,” Arkk said, holding a gold coin in one hand. He had beaten the man over the head with the stick. It was time for the carrot. “Are you going to work with me and walk out of here on your own?” He held out his other hand, motioning toward Vezta. “Or are we being a little more aggressive in getting you out?”

Vezta unleashed one of his hands. There was a slight hesitation but he reached out quickly enough and took the coin from Arkk’s hand.

The employee bond formed. It felt a bit weaker than most others but it was there *enough*  that Arkk didn’t feel like anything was wrong.

Arkk gave Savren a smile. “Vezta. What are you doing? We don’t treat employees this way.”

All of Vezta’s tendrils snapped back to her, dropping Savren into a pile that he quickly picked himself up from. “My apologies, Master.”

“It’s fine. I’m sure Savren is just happy to be free,” Arkk said, watching the man rub at his wrists where Vezta had tethered him. “These books, are there any others around? Anything else valuable?”

Savren stood still, frowning to himself for a long moment before he realized Arkk was talking to him. “Uh. No.” He cleared his throat and tried to smooth down the front of his dirty robes. “Unless you set your sights on the silver.”

“Tempting, but I think I’ll leave that to the villagers. I’m sure they wouldn’t thank me if I set the servants to eating this place.”

“Eating?” Savren said, looking like he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know.

Arkk paid him little mind. “Vezta, can you carry all these and see them back to Fortress Al-Mir’s library?”

“Certainly, Master,” she said, setting several tendrils to pick up the stacks of books. She carried them over to herself and then held them in her regular arms.

“The plan from here is to get the gorgon and Savren back to the fortress,” Arkk said. “You’ll see them through the ritual circles. I will take the villagers back to the village and see how much renown I can get from the village here. Maybe get them to spread Al-Mir’s name far and wide. I’ll even turn down their silver reward,” he said with a grin. “Al-Mir is strong enough to clear out a den of gorgon with only two people and kind enough to do it out of the goodness of our hearts.”

“A most devious plan, Master.”

“Devious?”

“Well, most plans appear devious when you speak them with glowing red eyes.”

Arkk blinked twice. Taking in a deep breath, he allowed his irritation to fade away.

“Much more genuine, Master,” Vezta said with a smile. “Will you be alright here on your own?”

“You saw that village when we passed through it. They’d be throwing me the greatest feast they can manage if I allowed it.” Arkk pressed his lips together. “I won’t, of course. They don’t have the supplies and I’ll need to get back to the fortress as soon as possible. Try to keep the gorgon from interacting with anyone else before I get back. And if Rekk’ar finds out about them, try to keep him from deserting while you’re at it.”

“Understood,” Vezta said, bowing with the books in her arms. “Any other impossible orders for me?”

Arkk looked over at Savren with a frown. “Keep an eye on him.”

“Naturally.”

“Good. Then let’s get out of here.”

## 42 - Silver City Aftermath


Zharja stared around what was to be her new home with middling curiosity. Smooth walls. Smooth floors. It wasn’t natural. That didn’t necessarily mean it was bad, just that it meant someone had built it. The same could be said of the mines, though they felt more naturalistic with the exposed raw stone and dirt.

There wasn’t much to it. At least not in the small section the gorgon had been given. Although it was smaller than the mines, most of the others didn’t mind. Between the large room filled with nothing but chickens and small piglets that they were free to eat whenever the mood struck and the strange magic that granted them each personalized dwellings, most of the others were lazing about, enjoying the coma that came with filled stomachs.

In truth, Zharja found it hard to leave her new dwelling as well. What had once been a plain room with oddly-patterned fabric coating the floor had turned into the perfect spot to lounge about. There was a large stone, warmed by a bright glowing stone overhead, that was perfect to coil up on top. If she got too warm, the stone sat right next to a large, marshy pool, deep enough that she could entirely submerge herself, hiding from the world above. In the two days she had been at this fortress, Zharja had taken to coiling her upper half against the rock while letting her tail dangle into the water.

It was… soothing.

She could understand the others wanting to rest. Those mines, while safe, hadn’t provided plentiful food or warm, sun-baked rocks to rest against.

Today, however, Zharja had dragged herself away from her rock to further explore the corridors of her new home.

The fortress was made up of long corridors, often with several doors on either side. The corridors would occasionally split, leading to a branch of more corridors with their own doors. Most were empty. Boring. Good hiding places if she needed them but nothing worth exploring.

There was one problem with this place.

It was too… *samey*. In a proper cavern or even the mines, there were ways to tell where she was. Markings on the wall, odd outcroppings of rocks or stalactites overhead in the more natural caverns. Here, there were stone brick corridors and stone tiled floors. Each corridor was the same as the last.

Zharja didn’t want to admit it, but she had no idea which way to go to get back to her rock.

Tongue darting from between her lips, Zharja tasted the air, identifying a number of different scents. In a split second, her mind categorized each and every one. She dismissed the scent of leather, cloth, metal, wood, and other inanimates. None were important. It was just the scent of the building around her and the items within. They couldn’t hurt her.

It was the other scents that had her tail twitching with nervous tension.

Sweat, muscle, meat. There were orcs here. The strange creature with a smell she couldn’t quite place had told her that. The taste they left in the air was similar to humans except more… volatile. Aggressive. She could taste the aggression mixed in with their sweat. Their fear as well. Shortly after the new human returned, the taste of the orcs changed. The anger had spiked and the fear permeated the air.

The strange creature warned the gorgon against interacting with the orcs, at least for a while.

That was fine with Zharja. She had no intentions of interacting with anyone if she could help it.

Moving down the corridors, Zharja found herself drawn to a room of heat that smelled strongly of metal and sweat. The corridors of the fortress weren’t exactly cold—warmer than the mines—but if she were in charge of the place, the lights that heated her rock would be lining every corridor.

Turning a corner, she approached the warmest door in the new hall. It, like all other doors in this place, swung open for her as soon as she approached.

A truly massive hearth, lit with bright orange coals, dominated the entire back wall of the room. Large bellows pumped up and down on their own, attached by chains. A rack of metal ingots lined another wall while flowing water ran through troughs on the opposite side of the room. In between, several anvils sat out on the floor.

An orc stood at one of the anvils, raising a hammer and bringing it down on a bit of metal. Sparks erupted into the air with every strike.

At her appearance, the orc paused. He looked over to Zharja and immediately froze.

Zharja stared back. So much for not disturbing the orcs of this fortress.

She didn’t know why the elders of the den had chosen to abandon one human for another. She supposed it was better that Arkk wasn’t deceiving them as Savren had done. Although she thought the den would be better off on its own—at least, she had thought that before growing to like her rock and the plentiful food—still, she had no intentions of causing trouble. Savren had never seen fit to punish her for any transgressions. She didn’t want to give their new leader cause.

“I am not going to turn you to sstone,” Zharja said, hoping this orc wouldn’t panic and call down Arkk on them. She deliberately glanced away, looking down at the item he had been hammering out.

A gauntlet? Made for humans—or something else with five fingers.

The orc jolted, staring contest broken. Clearing his throat, he reached into the pouch on his apron and pulled out a ragged, blackened cloth. Wiping it over his face might have mopped up some of the orc’s sweat but it only served to smear around the soot.

“Heard there were gorgon around,” he grumbled, still staring at her. “You need something or just scaring people for no good reason.”

Not willing to admit that she had gotten lost, Zharja slowly moved about the room, examining the racks of half-finished weapons on the walls, bits of armor pieces, and the odd components that looked like they were made for larger contraptions. “You are a craftssman?”

“I volunteered for the forge. Better than marching or fighting,” the orc said, wiping his face once again. It had little effect. “Think I’m actually getting good at it these days.”

“What are you working on?”

He held up the vambrace he had been working on. “Arkk wants all fighters fully armored and ready for battle. Don’t know why. Orcs have tough skin. Cover the vitals. Cover the arms to block blows. Take everything else and bare the scars with pride.”

“I ssee. What battle approachess?”

“Hopefully nothing,” the orc said, relaxing enough to pick up his hammer once again. “Got some humans breathing down our necks,” he said, slamming his hammer down. “But he’s got a plan for dealing with them without a big fight. This is just in case.” A few sparks jumped up as he hammered again. “You wanting armor? Never made anything for a snake before. Might be interesting.”

“I have tough sscales,” Zharja said, echoing his statement. “Clothess and armor would get in the way,” she said, slithering around as a demonstration.

“Maybe down there, but your head? Chest? You got vitals in there?”

“I… don’t know.”

“Where is your heart? Your stomach? Your lungs?”

Zharja blinked. How would she know? She had never seen inside herself.

Perhaps one of the elders would know.

“Well, probably doesn’t matter much right now,” the orc said, slamming his hammer down again. “Too busy with this work. Perhaps later.”

“Perhapss.” Zharja moved closer to the door. “I sshall leave you to your work.”

The orc didn’t respond, his focus returned to his hammering before the doors closed behind Zharja.

Zharja remained outside for a short moment before slithering down the hall in the same direction she had come from. If this was the orc section of the fortress, she didn’t want to meet any others. The first had been pleasant enough. There was no guarantee that any others would be the same.

A despondent, lithe grace hit Zharja’s tongue as she explored the corridors. Elves, it had to be. There weren’t as many elves as there were orcs. One of them smelled more like a human than an elf but the other two… Death lingered in the air around them. Perhaps that was why all three smelled distraught.

She did not head toward the scent. Meeting with the orc had been enough interaction for the day.

Other scents hit her as she tasted the air once again. Not far from the sad elves, she could taste more humans. Again, not very many compared to the orcs. If she hadn’t already met the leaders of this place, she would have thought the orcs were in charge.

One room smelled of books and Savren. Zharja moved right past without a second glance. Although she had been warned against interacting with the orcs, she didn’t care much about them one way or the other. That indifference did not extend to Savren. His… betrayal stung. Zharja wasn’t sure that she would be able to stop herself from turning him to stone if he stepped in front of her.

Beyond the room of books, Zharja came across a room that smelled of cut trees. A thick layer of wood dust coated the floor outside the door. She paused in it, feeling it under her scales. It was an interesting sensation. Like dirt but smoother. It soaked up the little moisture on her scales. Not an unpleasant feeling.

Zharja’s delay cost her. The door swung open of its own accord.

“—lesson time with Zu—Ah!”

A tiny human stepped out, bumping right into Zharja.

Zharja looked down, waiting with mild resignation for the tiny human to start screaming. Instead, the girl just stared up with wide eyes. A quick taste of the air detected a slight sensation of fear, but nothing close to what she expected.

“You are *so* pretty.”

Zharja blinked.

“Hale! Get away!”

Looking up from the tiny human, Zharja saw an older man further back in the workshop. *There* was the fear. Despite that fear, the old man still rushed forward, grabbed the small human around the waist, and pulled her back.

“Get off me,” the human grumbled. “Arkk wouldn’t let something run around that would hurt me.”

“You don’t know that,” the older human said, not taking his eyes off Zharja. Which, when dealing with a gorgon, was one of the more foolish things to do.

It was a good thing that Zharja wasn’t about to stone them.

Zharja looked away from the two, about to continue without another word. An extra taste hit the air before she could move. It just *appeared* out of nowhere.

Arkk stood between her and the door to the workshop. “Is there a problem? Zharja, right?”

“I wass exploring,” Zharja said, keeping her hissing as neutral as she could manage. “The tiny human bumped into me.”

The small human stiffened, dark hair on either side of her head twitching as she straightened her back. “It was my fault. I wasn’t watching where I was going. And then this *old man* went and panicked,” she said with a glare over her shoulder. “The snake lady didn’t do anything bad.”

“Snake lady?”

“Of course! Look at how pretty she is.”

Zharja looked down at her iridescent black scales. They weren’t gleaming much at the moment. She would have said that she looked fairly dull. “I will be sshedding ssoon. My sscales will regain their lusster after.”

“Can I see?” the tiny human asked, stepping closer again now that the old man had let her go.

Zharja stared down for a long moment before twitching her head. Realizing that the human wouldn’t recognize her motions, she affected a shrug. “Perhapss I sshall return then.”

The little human flashed a grin before immediately trying to look more mature, like the older humans. “Thank you,” she said, bowing her head.

A long moment of quiet fell on the strange group before Arkk finally spoke. “Well, if there are no problems—”

“Wait,” Zharja said.

“Yes?”

Zharja glanced back to the other two humans before motioning with two fingers further down the corridor. She wasn’t sure how far humans could hear but did know that everyone said they had bad hearing. A few body lengths away, she stopped. Looking at Arkk, she hesitated.

“What’s wrong? If Hale is bothering you—”

“No… No. Jusst. Which way to my rock?”

***

Hawkwood sat at his desk, staring down at the latest report from the Duke.

The Kingdom of Chernlock was made up of four states. Chernlock itself, the seat of the kingdom, occupied the largest portion of the continent to the south. Most of it was a desert but several underground rivers allowed civilization to thrive, especially when combined with the fertile swaths of land all along the Chernlock River. To its east, the Principality of Lockloch was a fairly small territory but contained valuable mineral deposits and the largest lake on the continent, providing fresh water to the entire region. North of Lockloch, the Principality of Vaales dominated much of the northeastern edge of the continent and possessed a large navy.

The Duchy of Mystakeen, north of Chernlock and west of Vaales, was a forested and mountainous territory. It didn’t have too many special features. Just mounts, trees, and adequate farmland. The only thing that made it notable was that it was the only one of the kingdom’s territories that bordered another nation.

The Duchy maintained a strong military. It had to. The Evestani Sultanate wasn’t always the most friendly of neighbors. It was part of the reason why White Company was exclusively contracted to the Duke. Reserve forces—or, more likely, fodder—while the rest of the nation prepared in the event of an invasion.

In the last hundred days, the peace seemed to be wearing thin. If the Duke’s spymaster was to be believed, Evestani was marshaling its forces. The spymaster didn’t know why they were suddenly building up their army—if they did, they hadn’t seen fit to inform Hawkwood about it—but that didn’t change what was likely to happen.

“Thirty years since the last war ended,” Hawkwood mumbled, taking a drink from his teacup. “Fifty years since the last war began. How long will this one last?”

“Not long if they put you in charge, Sir.”

Lowering the spymaster’s report, Hawkwood looked up. His adjutant, Neil, stepped through the door, holding a few more papers in his hands.

“Doubt I’ll be doing much. Throwing away good men while the proper armies make sure their swords are polished.” He let out a long sigh. “More word from the spymaster?” he asked, nodding toward his adjutant’s papers.

“Not quite. You asked me to keep informed of Company Al-Mir’s activities.”

Welcoming the distraction, Hawkwood hurriedly waved Neil further into the room. “And what has Arkk been up to since he fought off that horde of monsters at Darkwood?”

“It seems some inquisitors took interest in his activities after that. Reports say they cleared out the remainder of the monsters at Darkwood and now they’re poking around some Cursed Forest south of Smilesville Burg.”

Smilesville… Hawkwood turned around in his chair, facing the large map of the territory. It took him a few moments to find it. “Not far from Langleey. Wasn’t that where Arkk said he was from? He seemed like a good sort. Wonder what they’re doing.”

“It might have something to do with what he did after.”

“After? Wasn’t he wounded?”

“Back on his feet, according to this. Arkk and a single associate—a demihuman of undetermined type—showed themselves at Silver City one week ago.”

Hawkwood clapped a hand to his forehead, rubbing at his hair. “The gorgon job. I told him not to take it. Two people aren’t enough to assault a den of gorgon. Was he there for other matters?”

“No. He marched through the town with several dead chickens slung over his shoulders.”

“Poison? Gorgons would have smelled it.”

“Not sure. All we know is that he entered the mines alone, according to witnesses.”

Hawkwood closed his eyes, letting out a long sigh. “Shame.”

“He walked out about two hours after, helping several formerly petrified humans back to the village. Claimed he dealt with the gorgon and that they wouldn’t be back.”

“Excuse me?”

“Silver City’s baron, Geno, tried to throw a feast. Arkk just left. Didn’t even take the reward they were offering. They sent a few volunteers into the mines and couldn’t find any trace of the gorgon.”

“I… Good thing I wasn’t taking a drink of my tea. I might have made a mess.”

“It gets better.”

Hawkwood raised an eyebrow. “He did something else?”

“Did you hear what happened to Hope’s Rest Village?”

“Terrible business,” Hawkwood said with a nod of his head. “Some kind of stasis spell over the entire village.”

“Well, two days ago, Arkk found a ritual circle hidden behind a wall in the catacombs beneath the village church. Destroying the ritual circle woke up the villagers. The village is lost—without anyone to tend to the crops, pretty much everything died. Our illustrious duke wanted to send tax collectors out upon the news reaching him—”

“Bastard.”

“—but was convinced not to by one of his advisors. The elf, I gather.”

“Good thing *someone* in his manor has some sense to them. I don’t suppose she convinced him to send some of his taxed goods as support?”

Adjutant Neil shook his head slowly. “Not sure what is going to happen to the village yet. I’d put coin down on them splitting apart to nearby villages that will take them in.”

“At least the people survived. They can always return to their homes in the spring and try to get their village going.”

Neil didn’t say anything. He merely set down the papers he had been looking over while delivering his report, allowing Hawkwood to read them at his leisure.

“Sounds like Arkk did some good. More than good. Estimates were six to ten gorgon? Would have lost half our company clearing them out. *And* he recovered the petrified miners then casually went…” Hawkwood trailed off, looking back to his map. He found the mountains where Silver City was nestled then dragged his eyes across the Duchy to Hope, not too far from Cliff. The distance between the two wasn’t insignificant. A single rider could travel much faster than a group, but to make it across Mystakeen in a week?

“Huh.”

“Something wrong?” Neil asked.

“No, no. Just thinking,” Hawkwood said with a shake of his head. “Arkk did very well for himself. Glad I had the opportunity to help guide him along, even if it seems like he ignored my advice about the gorgon. Any chance we can lean on the inquisitors and get them to back off?”

“I could ask around.”

“Do it. See if you can figure out what they’re after and maybe get them to back off. Saving two villages? Doesn’t deserve to be hounded like that.”

“Understood, Sir.” Neil ducked his head, bowing out of the room.

“Before you go,” Hawkwood said, frowning down at his empty teacup. “See if you can’t get some more Evestani tea imported. And quickly.” His eyes drifted over to the spymaster’s report. “Might not have much of a chance in the near future.”

## 43 - The Evening Before


“Alright. Let’s go over this one more time,” Arkk said, looking around his meeting table.

Vezta stood a step behind and just to the side of him, looking calm and serene as usual. Khan was coiled up directly across from Arkk, hands gently resting on the table. Ilya, Zullie, Rekk’ar, and Olatt’an were split on either side, none paying too much attention to Arkk as they stared at the gorgon in their midst. For once, it seemed like Vezta wasn’t the strangest thing around. Or, more accurately, people had gotten used to her but were still highly wary of the gorgon.

“Tomorrow morning,” Arkk continued, trying to pretend like he had everyone’s attention, “the inquisitors will begin their search of the Cursed Forest accompanied by about forty volunteers, most of whom are just regular villagers looking to get a little extra coin in their pockets and not hardened mercenaries.

“It is a large swath of land to cover,” Arkk said. “Possible to traverse in under a day if you’re walking or running through it but these people will be searching. I don’t know how fast or how slow they’ll be moving. Vezta will be making use of our crystal balls to keep track of the inquisitors and both Fortress Al-Mir and the false fortress to the north.”

Vezta dipped her head in a slight bow, acknowledging her part in the plan.

“We don’t want to make it easy or obvious for them, so if they do pass right over the small clues we left pointing toward the false fortress, we’ll let them go by. I *assume* the inquisitors won’t give up so easily, they seem quite persistent, but if they give up temporarily, it buys us time to work out even better plans for the next time they stop by.

“If the search parties do stumble across the false fortress, we’ll make a show of fighting them off. Based on my own village’s temperament, regular villagers will stand and defend their town to the death as long as victory seems plausible. Out here? The mere presence of a small group of orcs will likely be enough to frighten away anything but overwhelming numbers. We’re not expecting that. The mercenaries might take a bit more of a beating but we should easily outnumber them even with that team of orcs still at the lost pyramid. Even still, I want everyone to be careful. Remember that I can transport all of you at will.”

Rekk’ar didn’t even glance over to Arkk, focused entirely on Khan. Thankfully, Olatt’an gave Arkk a firm nod of his head. “I will endeavor to remind the others that they can garner your attention should they become injured or otherwise find themselves in a precarious situation.”

“Good. If the inquisitors enter, I don’t want anyone fighting them. I don’t know exactly what their capabilities are, only that they destroyed the Darkwood fortress. Given the monsters around Darkwood, that makes them a whole lot more dangerous than anyone else. When they arrive, I’ll deal with them myself.”

“Big talk,” Rekk’ar said, voice low and gravely. He finally turned his head over to Arkk. With his lips curled into a frown, he crossed his arms. “Would you remind me who fell to a ghast just a few weeks ago? These inquisitors can apparently kill ghasts with little effort if the destruction of that other fortress is any indication.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, stiffening. “That was me saving one of your men from having his head torn off in exchange for what was obviously a far less grievous wound. Remind me of who made your former chieftain literally explode.”

Rekk’ar flashed his tusks for a brief moment. “You have warriors. Use them.” He slammed a fist on the table, glaring before speaking again. “If Vezz’ok or Orjja dies, who cares? But if you die, there goes our cushy lives here, our pay, and maybe even our own lives if those inquisitors really will tear through the place.”

“That…” Arkk glowered. He had a point. The thought of throwing orcs to their deaths, even if they had once been attackers of his village, just didn’t sit right with him. Maybe he would have agreed a few months ago. Not now that they had gotten to know each other, fought at Darkwood together, and generally just *lived* together for the last three months.

“Boys,” Ilya said, rubbing her forehead. She wore dark bags under her eyes. In fact, she had sported those dark bags ever since returning. Looking at how hard she had to try just to stay awake for this meeting, Arkk felt guilty about dragging her away from the two elf children. “Please. Arkk doesn’t even need to fight them since we *want* them to destroy the fake fortress. So it doesn’t even matter.”

Zullie adjusted her glasses with her middle finger. “If they find the real fortress, what then?”

“Then we fight for real,” Arkk said, turning his attention to Zullie. “I don’t see how they would, though. Since sealing the crevasses in the ceilings, the only physical access comes in the form of the tunnels to the villages. All three entrances are well outside the area we’re expecting the inquisitors to be searching. The tunnels themselves are filled with traps and are designed to be collapsible. The only connection from here to the false fortress is a tiny tunnel that even a rat would have a hard time squeaking through.”

Arkk looked around slowly, watching everyone’s faces. Rekk’ar had gone back to glaring at the gorgon—which really wasn’t a wise decision in Arkk’s humble opinion—while everyone else had simply fallen silent. They had a plan. Arkk thought it was a pretty good plan. Most of the rest of them had agreed at one point or another. This meeting served just one purpose. Making sure everyone was on the same page.

“You requesst our pressence in thesse fightss?” the gorgon asked, hissing voice making everyone except Arkk and Vezta jump.

This meeting served two purposes. “When I initially made these plans, I didn’t know I would have gorgon joining us. You’re here because I wanted to keep you, and the rest of the gorgon by extension, informed of the goings on around Fortress Al-Mir. If you have input, I’ll happily accept it. However… your presence might be detrimental to what we hope to accomplish here. We want to lure them in and have them think they’ve won. If they see gorgon in the halls, they’ll likely run away and call down the Duke’s army on us.”

The gorgon nodded his head. “I undersstand.”

“That said… while I didn’t plan for your presence, gorgon standing at our backs would be a great boon if we do have to fight for real.”

Khan nodded, tongue darting out of his mouth before snapping back in.

“While you’re here, how are you and your people settling in? Is there anything you need?”

Khan closed his eyes, letting out a nasal hum. “Not at thiss moment. We are enjoying our new homess and belliess filled with real meat.”

“Good. Good. Keep me posted if that changes,” Arkk said. “And if your people are getting bored and want something to do, let me know what skills they have and I’ll see if I can’t get them doing something. Otherwise… continue enjoying yourselves?” Looking over the group once more, Arkk nodded. “If there are no other comments about the next few days,” he said, pausing a moment to see if anyone said anything. “Meeting over. Zullie, stay a moment.”

The witch, who had started to stand, stopped and dropped back into her chair. Vezta remained directly behind Arkk. Ilya didn’t move. Rekk’ar remained seated as well. Olatt’an stood and, with a gracious nod of his head, started toward the door, only to pause and let Khan exit first before following after. They turned in opposite directions just before the door swung shut behind them.

Arkk glanced around at the people who stayed behind. “I assume you all have something else to discuss?” he asked, already feeling like he knew what the topic was.

“Are you sure it is a good idea having the gorgon around, Arkk?” Ilya asked, first to speak. “John said one stopped by the other day and nearly frightened him to death.”

“Zharja. I’m pretty sure she got lost, though she wouldn’t admit it. Hale went on and on about how pretty her scales were. I didn’t think it was much of a problem.”

“Hale would—”

“One threatened my blacksmith,” Rekk’ar said, fist hitting the table.

Arkk sighed. After finding Zharja wandering around, he had run through a quick check to make sure nothing had happened. Given that Zharja hadn’t attacked him at the mine entrance, he doubted that she would have randomly attacked anyone. Someone getting scared and attacking first would have been a different story but no incident had occurred.

“I spoke with Perr’ok. He said she just asked a few questions. Even offered to make her armor—”

“As an appeasement,” Rekk’ar growled. “I said no gorgon and now you’re bringing them to meetings like this?”

“You said you didn’t want to fight gorgon. You *aren’t*. Khan is an employee, same as you. They stick to their section of the fortress for the most part. Even when they don’t, they aren’t attacking.” Arkk shook his head. “I don’t know why you’re so frightened of them. Everyone in this room is dangerous. I could fry you with two words. Vezta could tear apart everyone here at the same time. Zullie is a powerful spellcaster who knows more magic than I could even guess at. Ilya could put an arrow through your head from the next mountain over—”

“Please don’t bring me into this…”

“—and you hang around with a man called the Ripthroat on the regular. They can turn you to stone, so what? At least that is reversible.”

“They’re cold-blooded snakes. They don’t think like you or me.”

“They are intelligent, reasoning beings. That’s enough for me,” Arkk said with a shake of his head. “Frankly, I’m more concerned about our other… *guest*.” Turning his head toward Zullie, Arkk tried to force the subject onto what he actually wanted to ask. “How is Savren settling in?”

“Unhappily. Although not in chains, I think he *feels* like he is a prisoner here. He sticks around in his room most of the time, thankfully, but he stops by the library often enough that I have taken to facing the door at all times.”

“He hasn’t tried any magic on you?”

“Would I know if he had? A perplexing question. I’ve been setting up systems around my room, little reminders that, if I suddenly can’t remember, I’ll *know* he did something. And that is in addition to a few warning spells I’ve had active around me. That said, he might try something far more subtle that I won’t easily be able to detect.” Zullie shuddered to herself. “Are we sure we need him? Even aside from his concerning magical knowledge, the way he speaks is just… *slimy*.”

“You’re the one who said we aren’t going to easily be able to find people of your level for the ritual. I still have no idea where we are going to find another.” Arkk paused, then added, “You have checked Savren, right? He will work? Because if he doesn’t…”

“*Unfortunately*, he will suffice.”

“Then we deal with him for now. If he makes himself a problem, we get rid of him. I don’t suppose you checked the gorgon to see if any of them are magically capable?”

Zullie’s violet eyes flicked across the table. “Not to give into my associate’s paranoia—”

Rekk’ar snorted.

“—but I would rather not be alone with them either.”

Arkk glanced over his shoulder. “Vezta, can you assist Zullie?”

“I am beginning to feel stretched thin, Master.”

“I know. You have a lot on your plate, but—”

“I’ll do it,” Ilya said, sitting forward. “I can stick with Zullie when she needs someone else around.”

Zullie glanced over, flipping a lock of black hair over her head in the process. “You might be able to put an arrow through his head from a good distance but what good are you up close and personal with a gorgon?”

Ilya’s eyes flashed in irritation. “You want moral support or not?”

“They aren’t going to attack,” Arkk said. “Probably. The four older ones for sure. They…” He shared a look with Vezta. “They’re loyal with very little doubt. Half of the younger ones follow the elders. The other two… I’m keeping a close eye on them. They’ve hardly left their lairs, however, and then only to eat.”

Zullie drummed her fingers on the table. “Fine. On the condition that if even one of them is a capable spellcaster, we get rid of Savren.”

“But we need two—”

“Look, I signed up for magical research, not for dealing with monsters.” A strange look came over Zullie’s face as she glanced at Vezta. “No offense.”

“If one of them is capable, we can run the ritual immediately and get rid of Savren after. We’ll turn him over to a burg to deal with.”

“Might as well kill him yourself,” Rekk’ar grumbled. “Don’t like getting your hands dirty?”

Arkk drew in a breath, glaring down Rekk’ar. He was getting a bit irritated with the orc’s demeanor. Rekk’ar had a number of *valid* complaints, it was true, but he was so *abrasive* about it that Arkk couldn’t help but find it grating. “I’m perfectly willing to get my hands dirty when it benefits me. In this situation, turning the Hope Killer over to a burg, captured by Company Al-Mir, serves me to a far greater extent.”

Something about Arkk’s comment made Rekk’ar smile. Not the angry bearing of his tusks but a smile. A nasty, unpleasant smile. “Good,” the orc said, standing. “Keep the gorgon away from me.”

Without another word, Rekk’ar left the meeting room, leaving the door to shut behind him.

A long moment of silence followed before Zullie stood as well. “If we’re done, I suppose I best ready my materials for testing the gorgon. Would you kindly transport me to the library?”

With a nod of his head, Arkk made a vague and entirely unnecessary motion with his hand. Zullie vanished, leaving just him, Ilya, and Vezta. Arkk drew in a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh.

“You alright?” Ilya asked softly.

“I’m fine. I saw this fracture coming when I decided to try to recruit the gorgon. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing but I couldn’t *not* do it. They have abilities that are just so… useful.”

“When did you start thinking like that?” Ilya asked. “Useful to keep the gorgon. Useful to send a man to his death—”

“First of all, that man is a remorseless murderer who tried to kill me the moment we met and might have ended up killing an entire village if his ritual circle went undisturbed for too long.”

“Still…”

Arkk just shook his head. He had goals. Rescuing Alya wasn’t going to be easy. Deposing the Duke? Even harder. He well knew that he would have to make some tough decisions at some point. Handing a murderer over for trial under the laws of the land was *not* one of them.

“What about you? Following Zullie around? What about the two elf kids?”

“John and Hale have been spending time with them. They’re… I don’t know what to do. They seem better with Hale especially. Something to distract me for a while sounds like a good thing, honestly. This isn’t something I’m looking forward to telling my mother about.”

“I could—”

“No. This is mine to deal with.” Ilya rested a hand on Arkk’s arm before letting her fingers fall away as she stood. “I’ll head out as well, I suppose. See when Zullie wants to test the gorgon.”

“Alright. But don’t push yourself too hard,” Arkk said. “Get some rest, especially before tomorrow.”

Ilya shot him a funny look. “Yeah,” was all she said before stepping out of the room.

Arkk leaned back in his chair, eyes drifting to the maze-like pattern on the ceiling. He traced a few long pathways, moving endlessly within those lines before his vision started to fuzz over from the repetitive patterns. Shaking his head, he turned. “Any thoughts?”

Vezta offered a slight bow. “I think you are operating optimally under the circumstances. I apologize for not being able to do more—”

“Your scrying is a valuable duty and I lean on you hard for help managing the servants, learning more about the fortress, teaching Zullie as much magic as you can, working with Zullie over the ritual, and your fighting skills and…”

“Still, it pains me to not be able to fulfill a task upon being asked.”

“Physically painful?”

Vezta stared a moment before laughing. A musical, uplifting laugh. Arkk wasn’t sure he had ever heard the servant laugh before.

“No,” Vezta said with a smile on her face.

The smile was a bit much. Although he could tell that her mannerisms were well-meant, it still was a smile too *wide* with a few too many teeth.

Shaking off the sudden reminder of her vastly inhuman nature, Arkk returned her smile. “Well, I hope I’m doing right by you.”

“Of course you are, Master.”

## 44 - Sick Tension


If Arkk had known how little he would have had to do, he might have been able to sleep. *Knowing* that he had forgotten something, that some part of his plan was faulty, that something would go wrong had filled him with enough anxiety that he wound up sitting awake in bed, going over everything even as the hours ticked by. Arkk now found himself sitting in the meeting room, twiddling his thumbs, wondering if he had over-planned everything.

Using a crystal ball, he had watched the inquisitors round up all the volunteers—a total of about fifty people, only a small number of whom were mercenaries—and *their* meeting. The crystal balls didn’t provide sound but he could guess at what they were saying from the motions to the map on the wall and the way they all split apart into groups. They were organizing *how* to search the Cursed Forest.

After about an hour, they took off, marching toward the border of the Cursed Forest. Most of the people were on foot but a small handful, including the inquisitors, were mounted on horseback. Despite their horses, they stuck close to the groups of walkers. Arkk assumed their horses were more for rapidly communicating with others rather than for searching. The ten groups of five were spread out far enough that there were fairly significant gaps between them.

They were *not* making good time. In fact, they were slow enough as they wandered back and forth in wavy patterns that Arkk wondered if they were planning on camping out overnight partway across. Having started from Stone Hearth Burg in the southwest, they would have to cross more than half of the Cursed Forest before they came across the false fortress. They would also pass over the actual fortress well in advance of that.

All-in-all, Arkk had stressed out over what was turning out to be a rather dull morning. At their current pace, they wouldn’t even arrive until the *next* day.

“Vezta,” Arkk said, glancing over to the other occupied seat at the table. When it became apparent that today wouldn’t see any significant activity, he had sent Ilya, Rekk’ar, Zullie, and Khan off to do whatever they wanted to do, leaving just him and Vezta keeping an eye on matters. “I’ve been meaning to ask but have gotten consistently distracted… How come I couldn’t hire on the two elf children?”

“There aren’t many reasons. If they were already bound to another Keeper, that would stop you. I doubt that is the case given the current state of the world. The Darkwood Keeper was likely an anomaly.” Vezta looked up from her own crystal ball, though a few of her spare eyes dotted around her body maintained their focus. “A few other magically binding loyalty agreements might similarly block your ability to hire. However, let me ask you this: Did you *want* to hire them?”

“Of course. I needed to get them here and intended to use Fortress Al-Mir’s magic to do so.”

“You wanted to use the fortress magic, but did you want to *hire* them? Put them to work in your rooms, have them assist your operations, and protect and serve you?”

Arkk pressed his lips together, frowning. “I hired Hale for much the same reasons. I needed to get her here and away from the inquisitors.”

“You intended to use her for the ritual. For the elves, you saw their misbegotten state and rejected the notion of inflicting additional problems on them by having them serve you. The [HEART] is aware of your intentions.”

Drumming his fingers on the table, Arkk hummed. “Alright. I’ll grant it that. But if it is aware of what I want, why do I feel like the elf children are prisoners?”

“Because they are. The function of taking captives is far more automatic than hiring. You effectively sequestered the elves away in their own section of the fortress and are preventing them from leaving. Regardless of your *wants* they are prisoners. That affords you certain control over them. The magic of the [HEART] treats them as if they are property, which is why you can transport them around at will.”

“Can I?” Arkk asked, focusing on the prisoner link between him and the elf children. He hadn’t tried moving them around. Not since initially transporting them from Smilesville to the fortress and that had been in his arms. Thinking about it now, he found Vezta’s claim accurate. “They really aren’t prisoners, though. They aren’t locked into their rooms or anything.”

“It is a power dynamic. Were they older, stronger, or simply capable of defending themselves, you would likely have to be a bit more thorough to keep the magic identifying them as prisoners. Yet they are children. Powerless children.

“Forgive me for speaking of my former master yet again, but I will say that he had entire rooms the size of the orc barracks dedicated to containing prisoners. Deep pits and oubliettes with large spikes keeping even the most deft of climbers from escaping. Magic dampening kept them from using any mystical methods of escape.”

“*Multiple* rooms the size of the orc barracks? How many captives did he keep?” Arkk could understand needing *some* space for captivity. If he had one of those pits, he might have been tempted to throw Savren inside. Keeping thirty or more captives in a single room and having several of those rooms?

Arkk hoped he didn’t have *that* many enemies.

“He fought in wars. Quite successfully, I might add. To further bolster his ranks, any captured alive would be… *tempted* to join him. He had minions in his employ who specialized in methods to *convince* people that life was better under him.”

“The emphasis you are putting on certain words is concerning.”

Vezta merely smiled.

Arkk didn’t bother asking for more details. He wasn’t quite sure he wanted to hear all that much about her former master. Instead, Arkk asked, “Do you remember the schematics for one of those prison rooms?”

“I truly only know basic rooms, rooms that my former master created while possessing me. A prison was not one of those rooms, unfortunately. However, a pit with spikes around the sides is simple enough to construct. The magical wards may be more difficult.”

“Zullie should be able to help with that, right?”

“I shall ask, if you would like. Although…”

“I know,” Arkk said with a sigh. “You’re stretched thin.”

“While I appreciate the trust you put in me to manage so many of your affairs, I do feel as if my talents are being appropriated improperly.” Vezta demurely motioned to the crystal ball in front of her. “Scrying is something I am capable of even while working on other matters, however it is a simple, base task that *any* of your minions should be able to accomplish with minimal training. Offloading at least that much onto others would allow me to focus more energies on more important matters.”

Humming, Arkk nodded his head. “I’ll ask Dakka if any of the orcs are interested in learning to scry. Keep it up for now, however,” he said, standing. “I’ll be back shortly. Alert me if…” Arkk trailed off, looking into the crystal ball at the handful of people trudging through the desolate wasteland that was the Cursed Forest. “Well, if anything happens. Doubt anything will, though.”

“Of course, Master.”

Arkk transported himself out of the meeting room. Not to Dakka—who was personalizing some of the new armor Arkk had ordered for everyone using some kind of red paint she got from who knew where—but to the section of the fortress he had cordoned off for the two elf children. It wasn’t far from his and Ilya’s rooms, just around the corner, and wasn’t technically restricted to any of his minio—any of his employees. To the best of his knowledge, only Ilya, Hale, and John had visited them since their arrival.

Even Arkk had been avoiding them as much as possible. Part of that was because he had been running around the nation, working. The other part was just that Arkk found them a bit… unnerving. They barely spoke to anyone, or so he had heard from Hale and John, and didn’t *do* anything either. When nobody was around, they just sat inside their quarters and that was *it*. It wasn’t living so much as it was languishing.

As Keeper of Fortress Al-Mir, he had brought them in. They were his responsibility. Avoiding them forever wasn’t going to fix anything.

He had no idea what to do.

Ilya, currently speaking with Olatt’an in the canteen, wasn’t with them at the moment. Hale was having an impromptu lesson with Zullie.

Knocking at the door, Arkk waited. It didn’t take long for the door to swing open. Neither of the elves opened it. Instead, John stood in the doorway. The old carpenter had a long apron on that was covered in little chips of wood. A few metal tools poked out of his pockets and he held a small block of wood, partially carved on one side, in his hand.

Having peeked into the room, Arkk had known that John was there. In the past few days, John had taken up the task of teaching the elf children to whittle wood. It was a good hobby and one Arkk approved of. There wasn’t much else for children to do here, unfortunately. Not unless he put them to work.

“Arkk?” John asked, a bit of shock on his face. “Did something go wrong with the inquisitors?”

“No. Nothing like that. I doubt they’re even going to be here before tomorrow. Maybe not even then. I got worked up over nothing—or at least too early—and now I’m mostly looking to take my mind off things.” Arkk leaned slightly to one side, looking over John’s shoulder.

Both of the elves dropped their gazes the moment he looked their way. They didn’t *flinch* away and the young girl didn’t fix him with a glare like the first time they had met. That felt like a fairly large improvement to Arkk.

Both held wooden blocks in their hands. The girl’s was a bit of a mess. Even taking a closer look with his Keeper vision, he couldn’t tell at all what it was supposed to be. The boy’s, on the other hand, was a horse. It looked like something he had been working on for a few days at least, given the detail.

“How are they doing?” Arkk asked, looking back to John.

John glanced back for just a moment before stepping out into the hall, letting the door shut behind him. “Better than when I first saw them,” he said with a mild sigh. “Yavin has taken to woodwork like he was born to do it. Might have done it in the past, don’t know, they don’t talk about their time before coming here. Honestly, might ask him if he is interested in more professional work.” At that, John shot Arkk a mild glare.

“Hale still wants to do woodwork, doesn’t she?”

“You and I both know that won’t last. The girl has been spending more and more time with that witch. Comes back every day with some new scribbles to draw on the floor,” he said with a sad shake of his head. “Don’t think she ever was this excited about new carving techniques.”

Arkk couldn’t help his smile. “There’s something special about blowing up your first ritual circle,” he said with a nostalgic sigh.

John raised an eyebrow. “Hale hasn’t blown anything up.”

“Really? Huh.”

“Anyhow, Yavin is doing well. I am a bit worried about Nyala though. She… Rather than carving wood, she mostly just… mutilates it.”

“Woodwork isn’t for everyone,” Arkk said with a withering laugh.

“If it was just *that*, I wouldn’t be concerned.” John rubbed the back of his head, tossing a glance at the closed door. As if they could hear through it, he dropped his voice to a quiet whisper. “She’s got some anger issues but she hides them well. They really just come out when she has a whittling knife and block of wood in hand. Don’t think she likes me much either. Doesn’t hide that quite as well.”

Arkk hummed, leaning up against the stone wall. “Think they want to get out of here?”

“They haven’t said anything like that to me,” John said with a negative shake of his head. “I wouldn’t bet against it, however.”

“We left our horse back at Darkwood,” Arkk said with a frown. “I’ve been meaning to see if I can’t purchase a new one. I noticed Yavin’s carving was a horse. Maybe he would like to go. And Nyala… think she would rather have a book instead of a block of wood?” None of the books currently in the fortress were well-suited to children. In fact, almost every tome was a book on magic in some variety or other. “Can she read?”

“I can’t really judge that. Not too literate myself.” John shrugged. “You want to take them to town? Now?”

“As I said, I doubt the inquisitors will be around before tomorrow at the earliest. As long as we don’t go too far, I’ll be able to instantly transport everyone back here if there is an emergency.”

Besides that, if they stopped by at Stone Hearth Burg, maybe he could get some information from anyone who heard Inquisitor Vrox’s speech and see if he couldn’t get a few more details on exactly what their plans were out here. Arkk didn’t like to call that an ulterior motive. Just using every opportunity to its fullest potential.

“Well,” John said, “we can ask them.”

Nodding, Arkk motioned for John to reenter the room first.

The door swung open on its own as soon as they decided to head back inside. The two elves were still on the floor. Neither looked like they had moved much in the short time they had been alone. Yavin, having picked up his knife again, did have a slightly larger pile of shavings around his feet.

Their room was fairly barebones. Plain beds. Plain walls. The only thing of real note was the woven reeds covering the floor and the odd give they had when stepped on. Like the floor wasn’t perfectly stable. Their room, like every other personal room in Fortress Al-Mir, used the magic of the living room to generate customized living space. Arkk wondered if the bare-bones nature of the room came from them being considered prisoners or if they just didn’t have well-formed desires for their living quarters.

“Hey kids,” Arkk said, feeling incredibly awkward all of a sudden. He had barely said more than twenty words to either of them. Did they even know who he was? “Don’t know if you remember me. I came to meet you when you first came here. My name is Arkk. I run this place.”

Both kids stared at him. Yavin had his eyes locked somewhere around Arkk’s chest, not lifting his eyes up to Arkk’s face. On the other hand, Nyala looked at him directly in the face. Her eyes were the picture of innocence but something—a hint through the prisoner link they shared—leaked defiance. She was testing him. Perhaps checking to see if he would beat her if she openly stared at him.

“So,” Arkk said. “You might remember I gave each of you a gold coin? Not much place to spend it here, is there? I was thinking about heading into one of the local burgs—I’m in the market for a horse,” he said, trying not to give a meaningful look at Yavin. The boy did raise his eyes, however. “I thought to myself, why not see if either of you wants to go to town with me? I don’t know that any horses will be on the market but I have a few books and other things to gather at the same time,” he said, this time trying to gauge Nyala’s reaction.

She didn’t react. Her facial expression didn’t change in the slightest.

Arkk suppressed a shudder, wondering exactly what these kids had been through before deciding that he was probably better off not knowing.

“Or whatever else strikes our fancy,” he finished, feeling a bit lame about it. “Any takers?” When they didn’t respond after a long few moments, Arkk glanced at John. “John will be coming as well.”

“I will?”

“And Ilya, if that will make you feel better about coming,” Arkk said, ignoring John’s surprised look.

Finally, the young boy spoke. “Horses?”

One word. Still, that was one word more than Arkk had ever heard from them. “Horses. If I can find one to buy, how would you like to visit it here at the stables?”

For their old horse, one of the rooms had been converted into a straw-filled pasture-like room. It probably wasn’t as good as being able to roam an open field but it was all they had. Maybe after the inquisitors left, they could build something topside. But that land was still a dry, dead wasteland.

The boy considered Arkk’s words for a moment before simply nodding his head.

“I’m going too,” Nyala said. She spoke clearly, not breaking her eye contact with Arkk. Lacking the trodden look she had sported upon their first meeting, Arkk might have overlooked some of her oddities if he hadn’t known better. She almost sounded normal there. Except… not quite.

Arkk noted two things. First was the subtle anger that John had mentioned. Arkk got the impression that he wasn’t too well-liked either.

The other thing was that this was yet another test. She hadn’t asked if she could come or said she would come. She effectively demanded to come. Arkk didn’t mind. He imagined her former owner would have been a bit harsher in his treatment after getting those simple three words in response to a question.

“Great,” Arkk said, hoping his smile didn’t look too forced. “Let me go speak with Ilya and we’ll be on our way.”

## 45 - Fresh Air


Stone Hearth Burg was a typical example of a walled burg within the Duchy. Three months ago, Arkk would have said that it was quite a large place. That was really only in comparison to Langleey, however. In comparison to most of the burgs he had visited in his travels, it was on the smaller side. One unusual facet of the burg was that almost every building was predominantly made from stone rather than wood. Or a stone-wood mix, generally with a stone foundation and wooden roofs.

The abundance of building material came from the quarry a stone’s toss from the main burg. Allegedly, most of the stone structures within the Duchy, including almost all churches and the majority of Cliff, got their stone from here. With such a chief export, Arkk was a bit surprised at its small size.

“Can we… pet the horses?”

Arkk glanced down in mild surprise as Yavin asked a question. Following the elven boy’s eyes, Arkk found one of the things they had come here for. A short hike outside the burg itself was a large stable with an expansive pasture fenced off from the wilds. Having asked around in town, Arkk had been directed out here. One family owned most of the workhorses that were used in and around the burg. Mostly in the quarry.

“Of course we can,” Hale said, flashing a smile at the elf. She tried to grasp hold of Yavin’s hand but the young elf flinched away from her. Undaunted, Hale took a few steps away and started waving. “Come on!”

“Hold on,” Arkk said. He didn’t want to stop their fun but felt it would be best for them to *not* be traipsing around someone’s property right before he tried to make any kind of business deal with them. “Let’s see if they have anything for sale first. If they do, you can ride it home. If not, you have to ask the owner first.”

Hale shot him a glare but Arkk shrugged it off. Yavin looked at him as if he forgot that Arkk was there. After a short minute, he simply nodded his head in a slow and hesitant affirmation that he understood, moving back to partially hide behind John.

Arkk tried to hide his sigh. He didn’t know why Yavin was so afraid of him. Was it just that he was new, relatively speaking? Arkk hadn’t done anything to the boy to give cause to that kind of reaction.

Nyala, on the other hand, simply stared straight ahead. Even with the numerous horses grazing and running about in the pasture, she didn’t even blink in their direction. Ilya stood just behind her, looking down at the young elf with a frown on her face.

Arkk shook his head. He wasn’t quite sure why he decided to do this. Mostly to get his mind off the inquisitors and their search. That was a task he could have accomplished doing just about anything else.

Reaching the large door of the manor attached to the main stables, Arkk lifted the large knocker and tapped it down three times.

The man who answered wore a flat cap and brown vest and had a scraggly graying beard. As soon as he stepped into the sun, he narrowed his eyes into thin squints as he looked from Arkk to the others with him.

Arkk quickly explained that he had heard that there might be horses for sale. It didn’t take long to be led out into the stables where a much younger man had a horse’s leg up on a small bench. The farrier was scraping and polishing the horse’s hoof, readying it for a fresh horseshoe. Yavin and Hale both walked a little slower as they moved past.

“I’ve only got one I’m willing to part with at the moment,” the old man said. He let out a loud whistle at the entrance to the pasture. Rather than call the horses, the whistle had one of the stablehands rushing over. After a few words between them, the old man turned back to Arkk. “She’s getting on in age—had ‘er since I was a boy—but still has some years left in ‘er.”

Arkk looked at the man a second time. If the horse had been around since he was young, that must have been an old horse indeed. “We don’t plan on working her hard. If she can haul a small cart between burgs now and again, that’ll be enough for us.”

The old man bobbed his head up and down in acknowledgment, clasping his hands behind his slightly bowed back. “Lucky you. Some of the boys earlier were thinking about taking her.”

“What changed their minds?”

“Me. Said they were heading into the Cursed Forest.”

Arkk stilled, practically feeling the awkward atmosphere behind him. A quick glance through his Keeper vision showed John and Ilya throwing each other a look. Neither of the two elves reacted. Hale opened her mouth only to be hushed by John.

“Once I ‘eard that,” the old man continued, ignorant of the commotion behind him, “I told them all to get lost. They want to get themselves cursed, fool’s on them. Don’t want the poor horses involved.”

“Huh. What… uh… could they be doing in the Cursed Forest?”

“You heard of it?”

“I grew up not far from Smilesville.”

“Then I ‘ope you’re smart enough to avoid it. A bunch of church-types from the city convinced a bunch of idiots to go running around inside for a few days. Mostly foreign types. Not locals. Paying well but not well enough if the boys never ‘ave a chance to spend it.”

“Huh,” Arkk said again, this time in genuine curiosity rather than an awkward attempt at finding something to say. Nobody in Langleey Village thought much about the Cursed Forest. There were rumors that people who entered would be cursed but most didn’t put much stock in them. He and Ilya had ventured in, a short distance, in their youth and got nothing more than a stern talking-to over it. Abbess Keena had hardly blinked when he mentioned traveling through it… at least until he brought over Vezta.

It made him wonder what kind of superstitions and rumors surrounded the place in the other nearby burgs. Not enough to *ask*, however. If this guy didn’t want to sell to people involved with the Cursed Forest, he didn’t want to talk about it. That increased the chance that he—or maybe Hale—would let something slip.

Luckily, the stablehand who had run off earlier was on his way back, bringing with him a tall black horse with white stockings up to its knees. Even with some graying hairs, she was still a beautiful horse. Muscular and sturdy. Quite docile as well, not at all fighting the stablehand as he led it over to the stables.

“Clover,” the old man said. “A good horse. Calm and eager to work. Too old to work in the quarry now but should suit your needs.”

Arkk nodded, walking up to the horse from her side. “Hello, Clover,” he said softly. He held out his hand, letting the horse smell him. He gave it a few moments before rubbing the sole white streak from her nose up to the top of her head. Glancing back to John and Yavin, Arkk gave them a small nod of his head as he went over to haggle with the old man.

Yavin and Hale practically rushed up to the horse. Nyala didn’t move, leading to Ilya leaning down to her. “Not interested in horses?”

“No.”

“Don’t even want to try petting it?”

“No.”

Ilya pressed her lips together and shot Arkk a look. He could only give her a shrug before he had to focus on the business.

The old man wanted a few too many silver in Arkk’s opinion. With the size of Al-Mir’s treasury, he didn’t mind but still commented. He probably would have laughed and walked away if he heard the price a few months ago. Now, he just pulled out a pair of gold coins. “If you throw in a proper harness and fresh shoes.”

No longer in direct sun, it was obvious when the old man narrowed his eyes at the coins. He took one, examining it closely. Arkk was well used to the suspicion by now. Hardly anyone walked around with gold coins. Everyone had to test them in their own ways, whether that was biting into them or tossing them into some alchemical potion.

The old man didn’t do more than stare, however. “Where did you say you were from again?”

“I’m Arkk, leader of Company Al-Mir. A free company that does work all over the Duchy. I was born in Langleey Village, however.”

“Al-Mir…” the old man grumbled rolling one of the coins between his fingers. “Sounds familiar.”

“Really?” Arkk stood a little straighter. “Well, that’s great news. We’ve been fairly unknown for a while now but I’ve been taking on some high-profile jobs to try to get our name out there. Was it Silver City? Hope’s Rest?” It felt like those were a bit too recent for word to have spread so far so quickly but then again, they were *large* jobs. Silver City’s gorgon problem was the highest-value job for months and while he hadn’t turned in Savren, the Hope incident wasn’t far behind.

Rather than answer him, however, the old man just hummed and then clenched his fist around the gold coin. “Well, if this is good, I suppose we can part with her old harness. It’s in fairly good condition.”

“And the shoes?”

“I’ll have Harry take care of those after Goldy,” he said, nodding back down the stables where Arkk had spotted the farrier earlier.

“Excellent. We’ll be back later then.”

***

The prisoner bond between Arkk and Nyala broke.

It was not a subtle thing.

Walking down Stone Hearth’s market, casually browsing for anything that caught his eye while making his way toward the local garrison, Arkk felt relatively at ease. The inquisitors hadn’t put his name or depiction out for the whole town to see. Nobody cared that he was walking around in the open. Quickly peeking in on Vezta showed nothing alarming either.

All-in-all, visiting the town was a distraction most welcome.

Until the warning bells hammered in the back of his mind. He knew the prisoner bond broke immediately. It was just instinctual. The reason for the breakage was less clear.

With the jolt, Arkk spun around. He made it just in time to see the glint of metal disappear into the sleeve of Nyala’s tunic. Hale and Yavin were off to one side, looking at a vendor’s selection of bolts of cloth. John had his arms crossed, watching the two of them. Ilya was just a step behind Arkk, a step ahead of Nyala.

The young elf didn’t make eye contact with Arkk. She didn’t have any air of defiance anymore. In fact, staring at her, Arkk thought she looked rather nervous all of a sudden.

“Is something wrong?” Ilya asked, noting the way Arkk spun around. She immediately started looking around, though her gaze remained on the crowd and not on the short elf just to her side.

Looking around, Arkk tried to piece together what had just happened. It didn’t take long. The immediate warning combined with the glimmer of light gave him more than enough information to guess that Nyala had just nabbed a knife as they passed by a butcher’s stall. The butcher was distracted with wrapping up a cut of meat in a bit of brown parchment.

Normally, such a butcher would have a large knife or hatchet to chop up his wares for those needing some but Arkk didn’t see any blades on his counter.

The power dynamic changed when she picked up and concealed the weapon. Thus the bond had broken. Probably. He would have to ask Vezta to be certain but, based on what she said earlier, that made the most sense in Arkk’s mind.

“Nothing’s wrong,” Arkk said, glancing back at John. “Mind checking out the cloth they’re looking at? See if any of it looks like something our tailor can use.”

Ilya gave him a flat look that *said* she knew there was more going on here. She even gave a brief glance to Nyala, who was still avoiding both their gazes. “Sure,” she said after a moment.

As she wandered off, Arkk knelt down. “Nyala,” Arkk said, pulling out his own dagger. “Tell you what. Why don’t we trade?”

The young elf’s eyes went wide as they locked onto Arkk’s blade. The actual blade wasn’t out, sheathed in leather, and the hilt was facing her. That was still enough to make her hands shake. Arkk internally grimaced, wondering if she was taking it as a threat, but outwardly kept his stern look.

“You can keep it,” Arkk said. “If you promise not to try to use it on anyone at the fortress.” He paused, thought, then added, “Without their permission, anyway. Maybe you can find someone to teach you to actually use it. Maybe me, if I can find the time. Or, I’m sure Ilya would be happy to teach you to use a bow.

“Or you can leave. I don’t need you at the fortress. I don’t *want* a prisoner or someone who feels like they’re a prisoner. I don’t want a slave either. You can walk away. Ilya might be upset but if you don’t want to be there, she can’t really complain. You can even keep the dagger when you walk away. But you can’t keep that knife you stole.”

Nyala’s eyes snapped up to Arkk. “I… can leave?”

“Whenever you want. I’ll even have the cook send you off with a load of food and that gold coin you got should take you far if you’re careful with it.”

“I can go home?”

Arkk shifted. “The place you came from was effectively destroyed. I placed a rather large bounty on the heads of any slavers in the area of Marrowlands Fen but I haven’t heard anything back yet.” Pausing, Arkk tilted his head as he considered. “Actually, has Ilya asked you about your experience yet? Anything you can remember, any locations, landmarks, or even names and appearances of people who took you might help us find more of your people.”

A look of strange confusion came over Nyala’s face. Arkk thought she was merely thinking back, trying to remember things she likely didn’t want to remember. However, she frowned and said, “Marrowlands Fen?”

“Did your people have a different name for it? The large floating reed island was deserted except for a number of bodies when Ilya found it.”

The look of confusion on Nyala’s face didn’t disappear. In fact, Arkk was pretty sure he only made it worse. She even mouthed ‘floating?’ to herself.

“You… aren’t from there, are you?” Arkk said slowly, feeling a spike in tension deep within his chest as he considered the ramifications of that. “Please don’t tell me that Ilya kidnapped *you*.”

If Ilya had attacked some innocent human who had taken in two elves and then dragged them all the way out here…

No. Both elves, upon arriving at Smilesville, had been covered in bruises and welts. Yavin’s ears had been clipped and Nyala still bore scars around her neck from, Arkk presumed, chains. Ilya might have been capable of misunderstanding a situation and attacked the wrong person, but she wouldn’t have allowed them to come to such harm on the way back. They *must* have been slaves at one point in time.

Nyala wasn’t answering him. If she was the forthcoming sort, that might have worried him. As it was, he figured she was trying to figure out if she could trust him. However, the butcher was now looking around for his knife. Arkk held out his hand, shooting a pointed look at the butcher’s knife peeking out from her sleeve.

With little more than a small huff, she handed it over. The prisoner bond did not settle back into place, however. Instead, as she snatched the still-offered dagger from Arkk’s other hand, a different, more familiar bond linked them together. The minion bond.

Deciding to think over that later, he quickly handed over the knife to the butcher, claiming that he had dropped it, then rounded up Ilya and the others. Taking them away from the crowded areas of Stone Hearth Burg, Arkk found a quiet corner and rounded on them all with a frown.

“You,” Arkk started, pointing a finger at Yavin, only for the young elf boy to flinch and take up cover behind Hale. Sighing, Arkk closed his eyes. “Sorry. Yavin,” he said, voice soft and gentle. “Did you live on a floating island made from reeds?”

“What is this about?” Ilya asked, crossing her arms as she leaned her weight back on one heel.

“Just making sure we haven’t had any *severe* communication issues as a result of… everything,” Arkk said with a frown. He shook his head. It might have been prudent to pay a little more attention to the goings on of his fortress. Talking with the prisoners, even if they weren’t really prisoners, should have been high on his list.

“Is that a knife?” Ilya hissed, stepping toward Nyala. The younger elf quickly slammed the blade back into its sheath and tried to hide it behind her back. “Where—”

Arkk stopped Ilya with a hand on her shoulder. He gave a small shake of his head then knelt down and focused on Yavin just as he had with Nyala a few moments ago.

“Yavin, you might not want to think about it, but I need you to answer my questions. Okay? There isn’t a wrong answer and nothing bad will happen no matter what you say. Understand?”

The young boy looked around, first seeking help from Nyala—who was too focused on her new dagger to return his gaze—then to Hale. The latter, giving him a reassuring smile, made him nod his head.

“Okay. You were taken from your home, right? You didn’t want to go to that human’s house where Ilya found you?”

Nonverbally, Yavin again nodded his head.

“Before that, where did you live? Floating islands?”

“Yes,” he answered, voice small. “Eures.”

“Eures. The name of the floating island?”

“Yes.”

Arkk offered the boy a smile. “Thank you,” he said, then turned to Nyala. “You *didn’t* live on Eures?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Wait,” Ilya said, looking paler than normal. “You didn’t live with that old human… He beat you. I saw…”

Nyala narrowed her eyes and then slowly shook her head. “They took me while I was gathering berries outside…” Her eyes widened and she clamped her jaw shut. “We’re not supposed to talk about Hallow Hill.”

“Hallow Hill. An elf community?” Arkk asked. Nyala clamped her jaw once again, refusing to speak further. Instead, Arkk asked, “When did they take you? Around the same time as Yavin?”

Nyala shook her head. “I was with the Master for a full month before he showed up.”

From the corner of his eye, Arkk watched Yavin flinch, this time moving to position Hale between him and Nyala.

“You aren’t siblings?”

“I thought the Master was replacing me… until I overheard him wanting us to have ‘beautiful elf babies’ that he could raise as his own. Fresh and unspoiled.”

Arkk wrinkled his nose as he glanced between the two elves. Their similar looks were… what, chosen so that their children would have similar-looking kids? He had thought they were siblings but that…

John started grinding his teeth together while Ilya let out a clipped gasp, covering her mouth with her hand. “He didn’t… You didn’t…”

Nyala’s fingers curled tighter around her dagger. Yavin didn’t move. Arkk wasn’t sure that either was an indication of a response. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.

“Was Hallow Hill attacked when you were taken?” Arkk asked, trying to focus on what he could *do*, not what had been *done*. “Are there still people there?  Your family?”

Nyala looked at him with a heavy glare. “I’m not about to tell a *human* about it,” she said with a curled lip.

Arkk slowly stood, nodding his head. “If you were to leave right now, turn and walk away, would you be able to find your way home?”

Nyala’s glare faded as a look of uncertainty came over her. Her eyes darted around the outskirts of the market as if she was trying to figure out exactly where her home might be relative to where she was now. After a moment, she hung her head, staring at her feet.

Arkk let out a sigh. He couldn’t be *sure* that she didn’t know—she might just be trying to fool him—but he felt it was likely. After having been dragged across the Duchy by Ilya and then taken however far away from her home by slavers, probably without seeing where she was going, it wouldn’t be a surprise to find out that she had no idea where she was in the slightest.

Still, that was a lead on other elf communities. Perhaps somewhere that would take in both Nyala and Yavin. Maybe people who would be interested in helping out with a ritual—or even just tailoring—if it meant helping out Ilya’s mother. Perhaps one of the local garrisons would have information on Hallow Hill. Failing that, maybe someone back in Cliff could point him in the right direction.

Until then… “Let’s get back to the fortress for now.”

## 46 - Invasion


“Status report,” Arkk said as soon as he teleported into the meeting room.

The previous day’s outing had been a welcome distraction, enlightening, and worrisome all at the same time. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—he had other, more pressing matters to attend to now. Namely, the possible invasion of Fortress Al-Mir.

Vezta had called him, tugging on their link, shortly after daybreak. He would have figured that this was too early for anyone to arrive, not having expected them until noon, and yet Arkk recognized some of the landscape displayed on the crystal ball in front of Vezta. Particularly, one of the dead husks of a petrified tree wasn’t far from the fake ruins he had scattered around on the surface.

Without looking up from the crystal ball, Vezta managed to make eye contact. “It appears as if some of our guests got an early start this morning. They just stumbled over some of the bricks you left lying about.”

“I *planted* the bricks,” Arkk said idly. “Leaving them about makes it sound like I made a mess and didn’t clean it up.”

Vezta didn’t comment.

“There is an entrance hidden not far from where they are,” Arkk said, leaning into the crystal ball. “Think they’ll find it?”

“They definitely noticed the bricks. Before now, they were mostly meandering. Now they’re actually searching.”

Arkk looked over the group. Four people on foot. One on a horse. Judging by their attire, which was made up of well-made gambesons and well-fitting trousers, and their weapons which looked professionally made, this was one of the mercenary teams. The horse had an especially fancy caparison draped over it, colored white and red with little tent-like symbols patterned over it. That was the biggest tell. The caparison was for pure prestige. It wasn’t practical to fight in and it wasn’t even really practical to search a wasteland in.

Honestly, Arkk wasn’t sure what it was for. Parading about and showing off, he supposed. They probably had it on now to show off to any other mercenary groups who showed up. Or perhaps as an advertisement, passing through various villages on the way here who might have needed help.

“From what I learned in town yesterday, the inquisitors warned everyone that the ruins would likely be infested with dangerous monsters. They didn’t mention you or even a creature from ‘beyond the stars’ or whatever, just that the teams were to report anything they found immediately rather than try to investigate on their own.”

“The horse hasn’t run off yet,” Vezta said.

Arkk nodded. Maybe they didn’t consider a few crumbled bricks to be anything worth mentioning. “I’ll make sure Dakka and her team are ready, just in case. If they find the entrance or leave the area, let me know immediately.”

“Of course, Master.”

Arkk disappeared before she even finished bowing in his direction.

Unlike his normal efforts to avoid disturbing his employees, where Arkk would appear out of sight and then walk to them, Arkk now teleported directly into the meal hall. Dakka sat at one of the long tables along with a few other orcs, all still eating their breakfasts.

Despite ostensibly being a mercenary company, Fortress Al-Mir was lax in discipline. People ate when they wanted, woke when they wanted, trained how and when they wanted, and otherwise went about their own business. As long as the teams he sent out to handle wolf culling or whatever other jobs he decided to accept actually did their jobs, he didn’t care much how they went about it. Aside from Rekk’ar’s frequent issues about avoiding suicide missions, Arkk hadn’t heard any complaints. He knew that orcs, or at least *these* orcs, took pride enough in their martial abilities to not fall into lazy habits.

From their perspectives, they probably felt they had a decent job. He paid them a gold coin a month. There weren’t many places to spend that money save for when they went out on their jobs. Still, a year of working for him would let them retire in relative wealth.

In times like this, however, Arkk wondered if he was being a bit too lax. They looked slovenly, hunched over, barely awake. They had probably been drinking all evening despite knowing they might be needed today.

Even Dakka looked sluggish in getting to her feet.

“Arkk,” she said, clearly putting effort into looking more alert than she actually was.

Arkk looked over her and the four she was sitting with. “How soon can you be ready?”

Dakka glanced between her fellow orcs. Katt’am, Orjja, and Farr’an. Two others were part of her team for this but neither were present in the meal hall. Arkk *hoped* they were getting ready and weren’t passed out somewhere.

Nevertheless, Dakka looked him directly in the eye and said, “Ten minutes.”

Arkk was tempted to say that she only had five minutes but refrained. “Ten minutes,” he said instead, letting her have the time she said she needed.

“Do we have intruders?”

“Not yet but a small group is close by. I want you on standby just in case.”

“We’ll be ready!” Dakka said, slamming a fist into her chest.

Arkk hoped so. He still made a mental note to warn the orcs against excessive drinking the night before an operation… especially because they were supposed to have been on standby the day before as well.

Feeling a tug, Arkk teleported back to the meeting room. He looked at Vezta in mild confusion only to realize that it hadn’t been her calling for his attention. Teleporting away without a word, Arkk reappeared in front of Zharja, the gorgon with the iridescent black scales. She wasn’t in the gorgon section of the fortress but was actually in the library. Yet Zharja hadn’t been the one to call him here either.

Turning, Arkk frowned at the stone statue of Savren and then at Zullie, who was seated at a desk casually reading one of Savren’s books on mind magics.

Arkk let out a long sigh as he felt another tug, this time actually from Vezta. “Now really isn’t the time,” he said before teleporting back to Vezta.

They could figure that out on their own. For now…

“Problems?”

“They found the entrance.”

“Already?” Arkk grimaced as he peeked in on Dakka and her team. They were still armoring up.

“You did leave footprints leading toward it. Once they started searching the area, it didn’t take long for them to realize that some of the footprints weren’t their own. Maybe some peasants would have missed it but this team knows what they are doing.” She paused and then added, “They still haven’t sent away their horseman to fetch the inquisitors. The rider dismounted and leashed the horse to one of the dead trees.”

“They’re going to investigate without informing the inquisitors.”

“Shall I interdict, Master?”

Arkk frowned and slowly shook his head. “Dakka will be ready in a few minutes. Unless they rush through, they won’t get very far before she can intercept. I would rather have the team report orcs over you when they run away.”

“The inquisitors are already aware of my presence.”

“Yes but only in a general sense. You were last seen not far from Hope’s Rest, which is pretty much on the other side of the Duchy. I was seen there too. If the inquisitors destroy the fake fortress without realizing we’re present… well, I don’t know what then but it seems like a surprise we should keep secret as long as possible.”

“If you’re sure, Master… It appears as if they are stumped by your door.”

“Oh?” Arkk smiled, sitting next to Vezta to look into the crystal ball.

A short staircase led down to the fairly shallow fortress. It was much closer to the surface than Fortress Al-Mir proper was. A few parts of it even poked out above the layer of crusty dirt, though they were fairly well disguised as Arkk didn’t want to be *too* conspicuous. Following the staircase down, however, led the intruders to a large wooden door. At least, it looked like a door. It was fully fastened into place and not designed to move.

One of the mercenaries had pulled out several metal rods that he then stuck into the locking mechanism. Which didn’t function. He could try fiddling with the lock as much as he wanted and the door would never open. Arkk had intended for it to be broken down, hopefully by the inquisitors using their magic so that he might be able to see what kind of magic they used.

Sure enough, the one picking the lock gave up after a few minutes. His friends admonished him, one even going so far as to swat him on the back of the head. After, they all started arguing with several making gestures toward the door.

In a pique of curiosity, Arkk teleported out of the meeting room and reappeared on the other side of the door. The seal wasn’t perfect on it which was good for him at the moment. It meant he could hear.

“—good thing! *I* wanted to tell the inquisitors.”

“We will. After we get first pick of the loot. Think we can knock it down?”

Arkk jerked back as something heavy slammed into the opposite side of the door. After two extra thumps, the pounding stopped.

“Seems sturdy. Maybe if we had some tools.”

“Quit that! What if something heard you?”

“Like what? I asked around town. Lots of scary rumors about this so-called Cursed Forest but listen to the facts, not the superstition, and you realize nothing lives out here. No plants, no animals, certainly no monsters or the surrounding villages would be ravaged. There would be rumors of things attacking and yet there is nothing of the sort.”

“Inquisitors don’t investigate places like this for no reason.”

“Yeah, well, they—”

“This door is wood,” a new voice cut in.

The statement got a few hearty scoffs. “We have eyes, Frank.”

“Yes, but wood rots. This door isn’t rotten at all. If this place had been sitting around for hundreds of years, there shouldn’t be anything left of this door.”

A long moment of silence stretched thin as the mercenaries quickly realized that there *was* someone out here.

“The inquisitors said there was a monster out here. What kind of monster puts up a door?”

“The worst monster of all. Human. Or demihuman.”

“Bah. That just means it is an easily defeated monster. You know what else wood does? It burns.”

Letting out a sigh, Arkk teleported back to the meeting room just in time to watch Dakka march inside. The shortest orc looked much more alert now than she had a few minutes ago. His appearance made her stiffen, straightening her shoulders and neck. She wore her new armor. Orcs, having fairly tough bodies, generally only covered their chests with armor and left their arms bare. Not today. Dakka looked like a proper knight of the realm.

Except, while the silhouette was right, her armor wasn’t a shining silver color. Arkk wasn’t sure where she had dug up whatever she had used as paint but the silver was tarnished and blackened with angry red lines jagged across the breastplate. Combined with the ominous spikes on her shoulders and arms that the orcs had insisted on despite Arkk’s complaints, she presented an imposing look. Once she donned the spiked helmet that she held under her arm, it was doubtful that anyone would realize she was an orc.

“Sir.”

Arkk gave her a nod before looking back down to the crystal ball. One of the mercenaries pulled out a thin book and started flipping through the pages. Upon finding what he was looking for, he began a fairly lengthy spell. A ball of fire splashed against the door a moment later and a ding of a warning bell sounded in the back of Arkk’s mind at someone attacking his home. It didn’t set the door ablaze but, after three more balls of fire, some parts did start smoldering. They would get through sooner or later if they kept that up.

Judging by how winded the caster was, it might be *much* later. He probably wasn’t a very high-caliber spellcaster. That book probably wasn’t that valuable either.

“These are our current targets,” Arkk said, holding up the crystal ball for Dakka to see. “Five men. One seems capable of magic but not that capable. The rest look like average warriors.”

“We can handle that,” Dakka said, cracking her knuckles. “Easy.”

“I’m not going to hamstring you by telling you to go light on them but we *do* want them to run away and tell the inquisitors.”

“Frighten them off rather than kill them. Understood.”

“Good.” Arkk lowered the crystal ball. “Are the rest of your team ready?”

“Should be. If they’re not, it is their own fault.”

“Good. I’ll move you all to the false training room. Feel free to get warmed up there until the mercenaries show then dispatch them however you see fit. Remind your team that I can evacuate you at a moment’s notice.”

“None of us would run from battle.”

“You aren’t going to have a choice,” Arkk said, motioning to the crystal ball. “I’ll be watching.”

Dakka curled her lips in distaste. “Whatever. You won’t have to evacuate *me*,” she said with bared tusks. “Enjoy the show.”

Arkk teleported Dakka without another word, sending her and the other orcs into the false fortress. The training room was a large chamber with several wooden facsimiles of people holding wooden swords and shields, not too far from the burning door. The orcs, after getting over their initial disorientation from being relocated, happily began beating down the mannequins with their very real weapons. Arkk was quite pleased to note that all of them had, indeed, been ready. Or, at least, they had their weapons and armor equipped.

“Think they’ll do well?” Arkk asked.

Vezta simply gestured to the crystal ball. “The mercenaries are not equipped to fight a protracted battle. They are geared lightly for travel. Even fully drunk and naked, I imagine the orcs would still have the edge.”

Arkk sat down next to Vezta, clasping his hands together as the weakened door fell inwards after a few hearty blows from the mace-wielding mercenary. With them now stepping into his domain, Arkk didn’t need the crystal ball to keep track of them. He could see every part of Fortress Al-Mir, including the false fortress, with little more than a thought. The warning bells of intruders violating his sanctuary started going off in his mind.

“Honestly,” Vezta said, angling her upper body to face Arkk, “their armor makes them look remarkably similar to the Dark Knights of old. A band of mercenaries ten strong would balk at even a single Dark Knight. If these people have *any* sense about them, they’ll run the moment they catch sight of the orcs.”

“Dark Knights?”

“An Underworldian order of martial combatants. Considered the elite among the elite. They appeared human but… weren’t. Not quite. They valued strength and power above all and were a bit annoying with how upset they got if they couldn’t fight for more than a few days.” Vezta hummed, changing the view of the crystal ball to the training room. She watched a few minutes, observing the way Dakka slammed her axe down on one of the mannequins, dismembering an arm and a leg in one swift blow. “I wonder if these orcs are somehow descended from remnants of them.”

“You said orcs didn’t exist in your time?”

“Not as far as I’m aware. Their physical appearance drastically differs but who knows what chaos the Calamity wrought.”

“Undoing the Calamity won’t… I don’t know, change them back or anything, will it?”

“It is just speculation. And, as I have said in the past, I wouldn’t expect such drastic changes. At least not immediately. Perhaps there is some magical link that was severed that turned the Dark Knights into the orcs of today but expecting them to suddenly change forms is a bit much for such unmalleable creatures. If this speculation has more to it than idle thoughts, perhaps future generations might see change.

“The primary evidences you should look for upon completion of our ritual would be a massive increase in magical capacity for any capable spellcaster as the source of all magic stems from the [PANTHEON]. At the moment, only three of the [PANTHEON] are capable of providing magic to this world, leading to the decline in magic-sensitive species, lesser power for those casters, and weakened artifacts such as the [HEART] of Fortress Al-Mir.”

“I see. Well…” Arkk trailed off, noticing the mercenaries slowing as they walked down the long entrance corridor of the false fortress. He still couldn’t *hear* them but he could watch them bicker among themselves once again. “Looks like our intruders have noticed the sounds of the training room. Wonder if they’ll be brave enough to… Oh, there they go.”

The five mercenaries slammed their fists into open palms three times, making shapes with their hand with each thrust, before one of them visibly groaned. Shuddering, he readied his sword and slowly approached the training room door.

This one was an actual door and was designed to open for anyone. It took a force of effort rather than the automatic doors that existed around the main fortress area. As such, the mercenary was able to pull it open just a crack.

From experience, Arkk knew that door *creaked* when it opened. A loud and high-pitched noise that grated on the ears. Watching the mercenary’s face made him laugh. Doubly so once the orcs in the training room paused their mock fights and all slowly turned to face the door.

As slowly as he opened it, the mercenary closed the door once again. Once it clicked shut, the man stepped back, turned, and started running. He ran straight past the other mercenaries despite their obvious protests. They shouted after him right up until the fully armored orcs stepped out into the hall, weapons at the ready.

“Well,” Arkk said with a sigh. “I kind of expected *some* kind of a fight. Dakka is going to be disappointed.”

“It is for the best,” Vezta said, smiling as she watched the mercenaries flee in the crystal ball. “Conserve their strength for when the inquisitors arrive. I imagine they will be arriving sooner rather than later.”

“True.”

“I still think we should slaughter them. Collapse the entire ruined wing of Fortress Al-Mir on top of their heads.”

Arkk shook his head. “That’s the backup plan.”

“Understood, Master. Are you fully prepared?”

“As much as I’m able, I think. We just have to trick them and ‘escape’. What could go wrong?”

Vezta looked over with a sorry frown on her face. “My former master was not fond of such statements.”

“We’ve planned a lot,” Arkk said, trying to fight down his own nervousness at the situation. “We’ll be fine.”

“Oh dear.”

## 47 - Turning Up The Heat


“Inquisitors incoming.”

“Good. Maybe.” Arkk took a deep, shuddering breath as he leaned toward the crystal ball. “Dakka?”

The orc snorted. “Hope these guys put up a better fight than the last group. I was looking forward to knocking some heads.”

Arkk teleported Dakka and her team back to the false fortress. It would be a bit strange for them to simply return to training after being ‘invaded’ so, this time around, they were going to be ‘patrolling’ the halls. Several more orcs were ready and waiting in reserve for when Dakka’s team made their tactical retreat.

After some consideration, Arkk had decided to take Rekk’ar’s advice and make use of the orcs he had rather than throwing himself into the deep end of things on his own.

The goal was to draw the inquisitors toward the false [HEART], falling back in a losing battle the entire way. It was a delicate operation. They had to put up a fight to keep the inquisitors from being suspicious without putting up so much of a fight that the inquisitors ended up retreating and returning another day with reinforcements.

“Zullie, are you ready?”

“Beyond ready,” the witch said, eagerly peering into her own crystal ball. “I hope that purifier uses her flames against the door. I’ve always wanted to study their magic but purifiers are rare and exclusively under the church’s control.”

It had taken a few hours for the mercenaries to find the inquisitors and then another few to return. At that time, Arkk had asked John and Perr’ok to repair the false door in the entryway of the false fortress. It wasn’t quite as sturdy as the original, having been a rush job, but it should prove a big enough inconvenience that they would once again use magic to blast it down.

The inquisitors and their magic were the biggest unknowns and, therefore, the biggest danger. Forcing them to use magic in a safe and controlled environment would give them time to come up with countermeasures. Or rather, give Zullie time to come up with countermeasures. Arkk held out little hope that anything would be ready in time for this battle now but should he cross paths with the inquisitors in the future, Arkk really didn’t want to fight fire that could burn even water without protection.

At the moment, the plan was to evacuate Dakka and the other orcs the moment they came into danger. For burn injuries, they would be relying on Vezta. It wasn’t something she had a lot of experience in but Vezta claimed that she could tend to most mild burns about as well as she could tend to cuts. Apparently, in her day, warlocks were capable of performing magic that rejuvenated and healed in only a few words. It came as a surprise to her that Zullie knew nothing about healing magic.

The idea that spellcasters had known healing magic was something Zullie found similarly ridiculous. Healing magic—proper healing—was a miracle, not magic. Arkk was a bit skeptical as well given that all the healing magic he knew of came from the Light via people like Abbess Keena. Even assuming the warlocks of Vezta’s time had been able to cast such magics, Arkk figured the traitorous Light trinity would have done something to strip those powers from people who weren’t of their church.

Shoving his thoughts aside, Arkk watched the three inquisitors descend the hidden staircase and approach the false door. Darius Vrox took the lead, moving casually as if he expected little in the way of danger. He kept his hands dangling at his sides, nowhere near the short sword he carried on his hip.

The chronicler, Douglas Greesom if Arkk remembered correctly, followed after Vrox. Like Vrox, Greesom didn’t wield any weapon. The short man didn’t even have a sword. Instead, he had a small note tablet in which he was almost constantly writing. Chronicler of *everything*, apparently.

Purifier Agnete followed along at the rear, being the last in the group. She moved with a rigid stiffness but, unlike the last few times Arkk saw the woman, she had developed an excited twitch in her fingers. The scars and lines on her face weren’t just faintly glowing anymore either. They *burned*. Her eyes, rather than merely having a bright light amid her dark pupils, were blazing with a heat haze hanging over her vision.

She was gearing up for a fight.

Arkk nervously tapped his fingers against the table, wondering if he shouldn’t get Dakka out of there immediately and hope that the inquisitors thought the mercenaries had frightened everyone out of the fortress.

The mercenaries, gathered around their horse and sitting dejectedly upon a stump, had been told to stay up on the surface.

After a few minutes of inspecting the door, Vrox and the chronicler headed back up the stairs, leaving the purifier at the bottom.

“This is it,” Zullie said with a wide grin.

Red-white flames erupted around the purifier’s arms, wrapping around her body before exploding outward, setting *everything* on fire. Not just the door but the stone tiles and walls and even the purifier’s own clothes. The black uniform burned away in an instant, revealing the purifier’s facial scars extended across her entire body. The door collapsed into ashes, having withstood the heat only moments longer than the cloth. The metal fasteners holding it to the wall began glowing a bright red before warping and melting.

Path clear, the purifier stepped forward. Her bare feet left foot-shaped indentations of molten rock in her wake.

Two of Dakka’s black-armored orcs stood just down the corridor. They barely had time to gather their wits before the purifier swept an arm forward.

A wave of flames careened down the hall, setting the walls, ceiling, and floor alight.

“Arkk!” Rekk’ar shouted.

Arkk ripped the two orcs out of there before Rekk’ar could finish his single word, dropping them into the meeting room just a *little* too slowly.

An insidious heat filled the room along with pained and panicked screaming. The heat wave was hot enough that it felt like Arkk had thrown himself into a blacksmith’s forge.

Zullie was on her feet instantly, rattling off an impossibly long incantation in a mere few seconds while Ilya took off her cloak and tried to get closer to the burning armor of the orc. *Tried*. The heat kept her at bay until Zullie’s incantation finished and a frosty fog flooded out from her hands.

Although Zullie said that the flames could burn water, their power must have lessened outside the presence of the purifier.

Ilya moved forward once again, using her cloak to protect herself from the lingering heat on the metal armor as she worked to pry it off the orc. Rekk’ar moved up and joined her, not bothering with anything beyond his thin leather gloves.

Arkk, not needing a crystal ball to observe the goings on of the fortress, quickly realized that the part of the fortress where the purifier was standing wasn’t his fortress anymore. The purifier had broken the claim he held over the territory. Whether that was an aspect of her fire magic or a result of her destroying the tiles she was stepping on was a question he would have to ask Vezta later.

For now, he teleported the remaining orcs, bringing them straight to the meeting room.

“You know, being jerked back and forth…” Dakka trailed off as she realized just what was going on. “Holy Light… What—”

“Later. We aren’t fighting that thing. Vezta—”

“I apologize, Master. My method of healing will do little for him. Those flames are not natural fire.”

“I *noticed*,” Arkk hissed.

“You…” Zullie panted, letting her arms drop. The chill fog dispersed over a few seconds while she caught her breath. “You recognize it?”

“Quite so. That woman has been chosen as an avatar by the Burning Forge.”

“Let me guess, one of your Pantheon?” Arkk groaned, staring back into the crystal ball. It irked him that he had to use it. This was supposed to be his territory. The fact that his claim was being destroyed grated on him deep within in a way that he couldn’t fully articulate. “That isn’t one of the traitor’s names. Are there more you don’t know about?”

“I am… unsure,” Vezta admitted. “Its presence is perplexing, I assure you.”

“Who is the Burning Forge?” Arkk asked, watching as the purifier continued advancing, seemingly not having noticed the sudden disappearance of the orcs.

“The Burning Forge is the patron of heat, fire, craftsmanship, manufacturing, automation, and creativity.”

“I’m only noticing the first two traits on display here,” Arkk said through pursed lips. He flicked his eyes up from the crystal ball. The orc who had been hit by the flames was still alive. The fire had swept up his legs, thankfully hitting the armor first. That might have saved his legs from being completely burned off but the armor itself had melted to his skin.

It smelled like a particularly burned roast in the meeting room at the moment.

“Do you know how we counter it?”

“I do not,” Vezta said. She then pointed at her crystal ball, which was *not* focused on the purifier. “They might.”

Darius Vrox and Chronicler Greesom were advancing into the false fortress, following in the wake of the purifier. The flames, still burning the stone and the walls, faded just a step ahead of him. Or rather, they faded just ahead of a small marble he held out. It looked glassy and crystalline. Like a small sphere of ice.

It also floated just above his palm.

Arkk drummed his fingers on the table, trying not to be distracted by the others in the room helping the fallen orc. There wasn’t anything *he* could do for him at the moment. The only healing spell he knew wasn’t designed for healing. Flesh Weaving required *flesh*, not charcoal.

“The purifier has destroyed my territory. Otherwise, I would just teleport in behind them, blast them with lightning bolts, and take that marble thing.”

“Forgive me for asking, Master, but is this not what you wanted? They’ll march through, destroy the fake [HEART], and presumably leave afterward.”

“True,” Arkk said. Then he frowned. “If they realize we tricked them, they’ll be back. As it stands, I don’t think we can fight that purifier.” Turning, Arkk locked eyes with Vezta. “I presume you aren’t willing to leave Fortress Al-Mir?”

Vezta went utterly still, not even twitching.

“I didn’t think so. I’m not either. Strange as it might sound, this place has grown on me. I don’t think I could abandon it.”

“You cannot,” Vezta said. “The [HEART] is your heart. You *cannot* abandon it.”

Arkk blinked once before his eyes widened in sudden realization. “If it is destroyed… I die?”

“I believe I have said the [HEART] is your heart before.”

The phrasing did sound vaguely familiar. She had said that once or twice. Still, Arkk felt a sudden tension clench in his chest that he hadn’t felt before. “You could have communicated that a little more clearly,” he hissed, noting the flood of red light that was emanating from his eyes. “We’ll talk later. For now…” Taking a breath, Arkk spoke louder, addressing the chaotic room. “New objective, acquire that marble. If it is our protection against that fire magic, we can’t let it get away while it is so close. Next time, they might send the purifier alone and then we’ll all be screwed.”

Him especially because it sounded like he couldn’t just run.

“Any suggestions?”

The meeting room was fully staffed at the moment. More than fully staffed with the addition of Dakka’s team. Ilya and Rekk’ar were still helping the downed orc—Katt’am—who might have passed out from the pain. The employee link was still there, so he was alive. Olatt’an hadn’t gotten up when the orcs appeared, choosing to simply observe passively through Vezta’s crystal ball. Zullie was only just sitting back down, still looking spent. Khan was the only other in the room, coiled at the far end of the table and casually watching the goings on. Arkk wasn’t sure what the serpent was thinking at the moment. He couldn’t even pretend to read the gorgon’s expressions and, so far, he hadn’t said anything.

Those in a position to look at him were doing so like he was insane.

Maybe he was. The others didn’t have quite as perfect of a map of the false fortress as he did—because it was literally part of him, apparently—but they could still see the crystal balls. While the inquisitors were extinguishing flames directly in their path, they weren’t doing anything to the flames that burned down the side corridors or rooms. Even if he waited for them to pass by one of the intact areas, he would still have a wall of that cursed fire between him and that ice marble.

Ilya was the one to look up and speak. “Do what you did to the orc chieftain. Send your servants to dig a pit along their path and have them take out the floor as Vrox passes over it.”

“Possible,” Arkk said, rubbing at some of the scruff on his chin. Teleporting the lesser servants nearby, he sent a few mental commands, having them dig out a small pit as Ilya suggested. “I’d have to enter into close quarters with them. We still don’t know what Vrox or that chronicler are capable of. Not to mention we don’t know how quickly the purifier will notice that her friends are in trouble.”

Olatt’an interlaced his fingers as he set his elbows on the table. “Is there time to make the pit large enough to hold a contingent of orcs? Dakka’s contingent of orcs plus our battle ready should be able to overwhelm the inquisitors unless they have similar flames.”

“It is doubtful they do,” Vezta said. “Avatars are rare. I would be surprised if there was more than one for each of the [PANTHEON] at any given moment in time.”

“Purifiers are well known,” Zullie said. “Plural. Not saying they’re common but—”

“It doesn’t matter whether there are more outside here or not,” Arkk said, ordering the servants to create a constrained yet large fighting arena. It was a rush job but the magic of the fortress wouldn’t let it collapse on top of them. “Vrox and Greesom aren’t purifiers. They don’t have glowing scars and eyes.”

Zullie dipped her head, acknowledging the point.

“Anyone else?”

“Yeah, uh…” Dakka, helmet under her arm, shot a glance down at her downed comrade. “If that fire bitch turns around—”

“We’ll be gone before we can blink.”

“Good. Not too interested in experiencing *that*.”

Arkk looked at the crystal balls. The purifier was making slow progress despite there being absolutely no resistance to her advance. She wasn’t in the slightest hurry to get through the fortress. In retrospect, he *should* have filled the place with traps as Vezta had suggested. Though they might have fallen to ash before they could do anything. Too late now.

“I’m constructing an area to fight in shortly before the false heart chamber. A servant will eat the floor just as Vrox steps over it. We’ll be ready at the bottom. If somebody, *anybody*, grabs that marble, alert me immediately through the link. We don’t know what kind of abilities Vrox has so be on your guard. Any questions?”

He deliberately glanced at Khan. With the gorgon’s power, Vrox would have been stoned the moment he looked up from his fall. Then again, Vrox might realize and close his eyes before Khan could work his petrification magic. That alone would have been a victory… It just felt too easy.

His position felt precarious. Like balancing on the tip of a needle.

The gorgon didn’t speak and Arkk didn’t want to leave his gaze on the creature for long, so he broke eye contact and swept his eyes over the rest of the room. It was a quick, haphazard plan. He could already hear the chewing-out Rekk’ar would surely give him later for not having planned for something like this. Still, it was the best they had on short notice.

Very short notice.

“Unless they pick up the pace, Vrox will be over the pit in about two minutes. Everyone who can grab your gear.”

The room burst into motion. Rekk’ar and Olatt’an had to grab their weapons, as did Ilya. Dakka barked out a few orders to those of her troupe that were still standing. Arkk waited just a moment before teleporting them and the reserve force of orcs into the still-under-construction pit. Dakka could explain.

Looking down at the injured orc, Arkk grimaced. Rather than just leave him here, Arkk teleported Larry straight out of the kitchens. The butcher, holding a large knife, swung it down like he was expecting a chicken to be in front of him. Instead, it slammed down on the meeting room table.

The overweight orc blinked and looked around.

“Uh…”

“Larry, I know it isn’t your job,” Arkk said, “but we’re in a bit of an emergency. Can you help him?”

“What? I—Oh, shit. He try dancing on a charbroiler?”

“Something like that,” Arkk grumbled. “If you can’t do anything for him, just make him comfortable. We’ll be back as soon as possible.”

“Sure, I guess I can. I… Okay.” Larry took in a deep breath, wiped his hands on his apron, and then knelt down. It was a bit awkward watching him bend over—he had only put on more weight since coming to the fortress—but Arkk didn’t have time to stick around and talk more.

Arkk teleported away along with the other members of his council—including Khan.

Arkk held his breath and glanced down at a crystal ball that popped into his hands. Three of the lesser servants were clinging to the ceiling, waiting for his command. Every other servant he had available was digging at the walls, enlarging the area to make room for the potential fight.

“Get ready, everyone,” Arkk said, watching as the purifier crossed over the servants. “Primary objective is the marble. We don’t *want* to kill him, if possible,” he added, still holding out hope that his original plan wasn’t a complete loss, “but do it if necessary.”

Ilya nocked her bow while Olatt’an cranked back his crossbow. Vezta repositioned in front of Arkk, ready to intercept anything coming his way. Dakka and her orcs slowly started to spread out around the hole in the ceiling of the room.

“Ready,” Arkk said, holding up a finger as he watched Vrox unknowingly approach the pitfall. “Ready…”

“Now!”

## 48 - Inquisitorial Support


The moment Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox placed his weight on his forward foot, the scorched tiles cracked and broke. He didn’t have time to think about the sound before the sudden feeling of tingling hit his stomach as he fell.

It wasn’t a far fall. In the interest of haste, Arkk hadn’t built the pit too deep. The ceiling was low enough that if the tallest of the orcs were just a little taller, their heads would have scraped the ceiling. A small tunnel connected it to one of the more intact rooms of the false fortress, granting him territorial control—he would be able to move his minions about the battlefield in an instant unless that was destroyed—but it was still less than an ideal place to fight.

Vrox landed hard, hitting the ground hip first.

Arkk focused on Vrox’s fist, *hoping* that the impact had made the inquisitor lose his hold on the marble. If he had dropped it, Arkk could have teleported in, grabbed it himself, and teleported everyone out. Vrox’s fist was closed tight.

Arkk shot a nod at Dakka.

Vrox’s landing didn’t elicit even the slightest cry of pain. Instead, he rolled to one side immediately and without hesitation, as if expecting Dakka’s axe. The inquisitor brought up his legs, avoiding a pinning shot from both Olatt’an and Ilya, and then kicked out, slamming both feet into Farr’an’s shins. As the tall orc staggered, Vrox pushed off the ground and stood upright.

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk intoned. Vezta moved aside along with his words, granting him a clear shot. He thrust out his hand just as another form fell from above.

The bolt of blue-white electricity shot out from Arkk’s fingers and slammed into a golden barrier just ahead of Inquisitor Vrox. The bolt glanced off, instead sending Kazz’ak into a shuddering heap on the ground.

With an aside thought, Arkk pulled Kazz’ak out and dropped him off next to Larry. It hadn’t been a powerful bolt of lightning, thankfully. Just one intended to put the inquisitor down long enough for him to lose his grip on the marble. Hopefully, the orc would be alright but Arkk didn’t have time to concern himself with the injury at the moment. He focused on the new arrival.

The shorter, rounder form of the inquisitor’s chronicler stood from his partial crouch. He must have jumped into the pit. The man held one hand around the golden chain around his neck and the other out in front of him. The tips of his fingers were glowing in the same golden light as the barrier that had appeared, leaving little doubt as to where it came from. He shifted his hand, angling the hexagonal barrier to intercept one of Ilya’s arrows.

“Impeccable timing, Chronicler,” Vrox said, clapping a hand on the man’s shoulder before stooping to retrieve a pair of thin-framed round glasses that had fallen onto the floor. Giving a puff of breath on each lens, he donned them, frowning when he realized that the frame had bent. As he adjusted it, he peered up at the hole in the ceiling. “Will the purifier be along after you?”

“I don’t believe she noticed our disappearance.”

“Probably for the best. I would rather not be trapped in a confined space with that thing.”

Arkk tensed, unease running down his spine at how casually the inquisitors were handling the situation. The orcs were trying to attack. Greesom simply shifted, pivoting with each attack to move that golden barrier in the way. It must not have weighed anything at all because, despite being large enough to cover both of them, he swung it around fast enough to block two arrows coming *almost* at the same time from opposite directions. All without apparent concern.

Just in case, he sent a mental command to the lesser servants to collapse the corridor behind the purifier. He barely had a plan to deal with these two. Adding that fire witch to the mix wouldn’t help.

“Well, Mister Arkk, I expected you to pull something devious. I must admit, I am disappointed… Is that a gorgon?”

“The Light protects,” Greesom said, squinting over Arkk’s shoulder. Neither even bothered trying to close their eyes.

Arkk licked his lips, tightening his grip around his only dagger. So much for Khan jumping in with his petrifying gaze to help them. The others would do what they could. Arkk had to focus on what *he* could do. With that shield able to reflect his attacks, he wasn’t willing to fry his own minions with lightning.

But this was his territory.

“Vezta,” he whispered, “try to get the marble from Vrox.”

“Master…”

Arkk didn’t wait for her protests. Teleporting, Arkk reappeared directly behind Chronicler Greesom. The short man was already turning. He had been turning before Arkk appeared. The golden shield intercepted Arkk’s dagger, stopping it cold. Before Arkk could react, the barrier vanished. Greesom stepped forward, hand now clenched into a fist. Ducking under a swing of Dakka’s axe from behind, his fist started glowing as he struck out a punch.

Arkk teleported himself and Dakka in an instant, shifting her position just a step to the side. Greesom’s fist struck Dakka’s spiked shield, buckling the metal. Better than striking her chest. At the same time, Arkk snapped a hand out.

Vrox grabbed hold of Arkk’s wrist before he could grab Greesom’s necklace. Arkk tried to teleport away again only for his eyes to widen as it felt like he slammed into a brick wall. His eyes snapped to Vrox’s hand around his wrist, instinctively knowing that the inquisitor’s hold over him was what stopped the teleport.

“Mister Arkk—”

A warcry from Rekk’ar cut the inquisitor off. He quickly released Arkk to avoid getting his hand cut off as well.

Arkk swapped himself with Dakka, right as the woman was in the middle of swinging her axe. It *should* have caught Greesom right in the back of his head but, again, the chronicler was already moving, bringing his hand over his shoulder to form the golden barrier behind his back.

Dark tendrils shot out from behind Rekk’ar, worming around him and lassoing Inquisitor Vrox.

*That* got the man to cry out. Vezta twisted the wrist of his arm, forcing his fist to open. The ice-like marble rolled off his fingertips.

Greesom pivoted again, swinging his golden shield around in a flash. The edge hit Vezta’s tendrils, slicing straight through them with no resistance. A blood-curdling scream echoed in the chamber, resonating with the high-pitched ping of the marble bouncing off the floor.

A sheet of ice spread out from the marble in a flash, freezing Arkk’s boots to the ground along with those of everyone else caught nearby. A harmonious ping sounded again as a second sheet of ice covered up the first, locking Arkk into place up to his ankles.

Before the marble could strike down against the ground a third time, Ilya came dashing forward, throwing herself into a dive before she slid across the ice with one arm extended. As soon as the marble hit her palm and her fingers closed around it—without turning her arm into a block of ice—Arkk teleported her back to the fortress proper.

He tried to teleport everyone else as well. Several failed.

Arkk couldn’t teleport himself. He couldn’t teleport Dakka, Rekk’ar, or Orjja. Vezta, free tendrils thrashing wildly while the rest of her was locked in ice, was similarly stuck in place. The ice was keeping them captive.

Dakka and Greesom barely seemed to notice. With Greesom’s shield out of place from helping Vrox escape Vezta, she had a clear attack against his side. He had to let go of his necklace for the first time since dropping down the hole. Using his forearm, he managed to bat the haft of Dakka’s axe aside enough for it to miss him. A second movement of his hand forced Dakka off balance, tugging her forward to the point where, locked in place, she couldn’t stop herself from falling. His deflection didn’t come without cost. Arkk *heard* the sound of bone breaking in his wrist from the initial strike.

Rekk’ar, wielding his halberd, didn’t stop his attack against Vrox either. With Vrox’s legs locked into position, he couldn’t even dodge properly. He did bend out of the way but the halberd’s blade still sliced through his thigh, spilling blood across the sheet of ice. Gritting his teeth in apparent pain, the inquisitor pulled a small ring with a square white stone set in the middle.

Arkk didn’t sit idle as the others moved, though he didn’t contribute directly to the fight. Ripping all the lesser servants through space, he ordered them to eat through the ice around him and his minions. Compared to solid stone, they ate through the ice in an instant. Before the inquisitors could try counterattacking, all of Company Al-Mir were free.

Teleporting everyone to the fortress, Arkk alone stayed behind. He did teleport far away from the inquisitors. Maybe it was foolish, but he still wanted to salvage at least part of his original plan. If possible.

Vrox clapped his hands together, muttered something under his breath that couldn’t have been more than a few words, and then planted his hands down on the ground. The remaining ice locking his feet to the ground erupted into a cloud of steam that rapidly dispersed. As soon as he finished, the inquisitor looked up with no lingering amusement in his eyes. “You fool. That thing will burn everything!”

Arkk frowned, thinking back to his last meeting with the inquisitor. “You control her like you thought I controlled Vezta,” he said slowly, realization dawning. Servant or not, Arkk didn’t *control* her. But Vrox thought the church could have some Purifier Vezta, or whatever. “I’m not *you*. Controlling—”

“We *must* stop Agnete,” Vrox shouted. “Whatever *our* issues, I know you, Mister Arkk. You defend the people. You *must* bring the Binding Agent back or that thing will destroy everything around here. You don’t want that.”

“Good that the only thing nearby is a desolate wasteland. Except this fortress. Shame about that, I rather liked this place—”

“Agnete won’t stop at the borders of the Cursed Forest. Your home village, Mister Arkk, is in danger.”

Arkk drummed his fingers against his thigh for a moment before shaking his head. “I’ll handle it on my own. You are too dangerous. Hunting me down like this? I haven’t hurt anyone. Now I’ve got to find somewhere new to live,” he said with the most convincing sigh he could manage, hoping he wasn’t laying it on too thick. “Good luck escaping, Inquisitor. Maybe I’ll let your mercenaries know you need a rope thrown down here.”

“Arkk!”

Teleporting away, Arkk didn’t stick around to listen. Vrox was lying. Or exaggerating. He had to be. Saying that the village was in danger was a ploy to get that marble back. The purifier might be a danger to it but as long as that marble could stop her, *he* could stop her.

And if it turned out he couldn’t use that marble… Well, it wasn’t like the inquisitors were going anywhere anytime soon. He knew where to find them.

Arkk reappeared in the meeting room and slowly looked over the situation.

He hadn’t kept track of everything that had gone on during that fight. There had been a lot of orcs that had all tried to get their hits in that he had simply glazed over. More than a few were injured. He wasn’t quite sure how. Dakka had a heavy gash from her shoulder to her breast which was bleeding profusely. Her armor, lying on the floor, wasn’t damaged at all. Orjja, Zojja, Klepp’at, and Hakk’ar were injured as well. It wasn’t until Arkk looked over at Olatt’an that a few pieces clicked into place. Olatt’an was nursing several wounds which looked like he had been hit by crossbow bolts.

That golden barrier had reflected his lightning spell at Kazz’ak… but it had reflected *more* than just magic.

Khan was the prime example. Arkk could feel through the link that the gorgon was still alive but Khan was just a stone statue of a snake at the moment. Hopefully one of the other gorgon could turn him back.

Arkk’s eyes widened upon spotting Ilya. Doubled over, clutching her stomach, she managed to force a smile as she held up the small icy marble. “Feels like I’ve been holding my hand in a bucket of snow for ten minutes,” she said, holding it out for Arkk.

Arkk brushed her hand aside, carefully peeling back the arm pressed to her stomach. “Never mind that,” he said, grinding his teeth at the gash in her side. It looked like she had been struck by an arrow, minus the arrow. “Are you alright?”

“I think so. I was aiming to be debilitating not lethal, as you suggested. I *think* that affected the severity of our wounds.” Her silver eyes roamed around the room before settling on Dakka. “Didn’t even realize what was happening until my third arrow. Not sure if the orcs realized and attacked anyway or if they just didn’t notice at all.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, looking at Dakka. Normally sporting tan-brown skin, she was looking more of a pasty gray at the moment. Her wounds were by far the worst in the room, having been up in combat far more than any other orc.

“Just sit still for a moment,” Arkk said, quickly intoning the spell for Flesh Weaving. It wasn’t a spell meant for deep or complicated wounds. Or, rather, Arkk had no practice healing deep wounds. Thankfully, Ilya’s arrow punctures were straight and simple that didn’t go as deep as they looked. They still took several minutes to mend with his spell. He didn’t have time to heal everyone while that flame witch was rampaging through the false fortress.

A thought popped into Arkk’s mind. Vezta wasn’t here. She *should* have been helping treat these injuries. A quick look through the link made him grimace. It was little wonder why she wasn’t present, looking like that. Vezta didn’t strike him as the vainest of people but she had a very specific countenance that she presented to others.

Arkk almost teleported away to speak with her before looking over Khan once again. An idea popped into his mind.

“Zharja,” Arkk said, noticing the illuminating red glow that gleamed off the gorgon’s iridescent scales as he teleported her into the room. “Does petrification cause any harm or lasting problems?”

Zharja blinked and looked around the chaotic room in confusion before her eyes settled back on Arkk. “No? You ssaw thosse at the mine.”

“Can you petrify those with the worst wounds temporarily?” That would give them a chance to render aid slowly on a more individual note. And give him a chance to talk to Vezta.

The black-scaled snake stared with her slit-pupiled black eyes for a long moment. Arkk, though a little nervous about suddenly being petrified himself, didn’t break his eye contact. Eventually, Zharja’s tongue shot out and she nodded her head.

“Wait, what—” Dakka started only to freeze in position, now a solid marble statue of herself. Five others followed, including Rekk’ar. Arkk hoped he wouldn’t catch too much anger from the orc later on.

For now, Arkk forced a small smile. “Thank you. I’ll be back shortly with aid.”

“Arkk!” Ilya snapped before he could teleport away. “If you disappear before taking this damn ball of ice off my hands, my fingers are going to turn black and blue.”

“You could have set it down,” Arkk said, accepting the small marble. As soon as it touched his palm, he grimaced. As far as texture was concerned, it felt like glass. The chill, however, swept through him with a fury.

“And risk sending a sheet of ice over everyone here? I saw what happened in the fight. Just glad my hand isn’t a block of ice.”

“Point,” Arkk said as he quickly slipped it into his pocket. The cold didn’t vanish entirely. It felt like he walked outside on a chill winter’s day. It was still better than holding it directly. “Good job. Catching that was good work. Thank you,” he said, squeezing her hand.

“Yeah, yeah.” She shoved him away, waving a hand. “Go get people help.”

Arkk didn’t argue, quickly teleporting to the temple. Vezta, noticing his appearance immediately, retreated to the shadows of one of the corners.

“Vezta,” Arkk called out, voice soft.

“Master,” a voice called from the shadows. It was different than normal. Corrupted and reverberating off the surface of the temple’s large pool of silvery water. “[Forgiveness]/[apology in advance]. [Request]|[avoidance]/[go away]|[query]?”

“Vezta, are you alright?”

“[Wounds]/[injury]|[sufficient]|[damage sustained]|[problematic]/[issue]. [Healing factor]/[regeneration]|[failure]. [Cause]/[source]|[PANTHEON]|[traitors].”

“That light shield thing was one of the traitor’s magics? And it’s interfering with your healing?” Arkk asked, nausea rising in the pit of his stomach. He stepped forward. “Are you okay?”

“[Fine]/[dandy]! [Request]|[avoidance]/[go away].”

Arkk took another step forward. “Vezta. I can see everywhere in the fortress and all my minions. I saw what you looked like now. It’s okay. I’m worried about *you*. Not about what you look like.”

Vezta didn’t respond. The shadows in the corner of the room moved in an unsettling, *hostile* manner that reminded Arkk of the very first time he laid eyes on Vezta. Several of her burning sun-like eyes peered out at him. He didn’t break eye contact, nor did he back away. He simply offered her his most reassuring smile.

Slowly, Vezta stepped out of the shadows. Except she didn’t look like the Vezta he was used to. Vezta’s body normally looked humanoid. A violet-skinned maiden wearing a long dress and white apron. She kept herself poised no matter the situation. There were signs she wasn’t human—apart from the obvious eyes or occasional tendril. Her body wasn’t fully… set in place. It was more like a congealed mass of slime forcing itself into a humanoid shape.

That humanoid shape wasn’t anywhere to be seen. An amorphous, bubbling mass of boiling flesh covered in gnashing mouths and exploding eyes squirmed across the floor. Thick tendrils, some leaking viscous black ooze, pulled her along. She stopped almost nervously in front of Arkk.

“You don’t have to hide yourself from me,” Arkk said.

“[Witness]/[observation]|[Lesser Servant]|[revulsion]/[disgust]/[gross].”

“True. Initially. I’ve gotten used to them. Most of all, however, they aren’t *you*. I am worried about *you*, Vezta.” Arkk paused a moment then asked, “*Are* you going to be alright? Is there anything I can do?”

“[Time]|[magic]|[required]/[desired]. [HEART]|[provides]/[gives]. [MASTER]|[provides]/[gives].”

Arkk took several steps forward until he was right up next to Vezta. Sitting down and putting his back to the statue of Xel’atriss, Lock and Key, he held up one of his hands. He hoped it didn’t look too disingenuous—his pose wouldn’t have looked out of place if he was trying to entice a puppy over to sit on his lap—but Vezta’s large form settled down. The sharp teeth of her mouths moved away, leaving a mostly clear section of her oily skin to rest his arm on while she… rested her head in his lap. Maybe? She didn’t exactly have a head but that was the impression he got.

“I’ll try pushing some magic into you. If you think that will help.”

Vezta didn’t verbally respond. She didn’t pull away either. So he started, closing his eyes and acting like her body was a ritual circle. Nervous about accidentally making her explode, he started lightly, just barely touching her with his magic. Slowly, he ramped up, pushing more and more into her.

Rather than explode, she seemed to deflate under his arm. Still, she didn’t complain. He continued for a long few minutes until he started to feel less bulbous mass and more thin tendrils of hair-like strands of oil.

He opened his eyes and found Vezta, looking far more human, resting her head against his thigh. Vezta’s eyes were closed as well. All of them, at least all those he could see. They stayed still for another minute before one of the eyes on her shoulder popped open.

Stiffening, Vezta slipped out from under his hand and to a standing position in a motion no human would have been able to manage. She pulled her arms behind her back and bowed. “I apologize for my—”

“Nothing to apologize for,” Arkk said. “Although if you want to make it up to me, several… Vezta. One of your arms is missing.”

Vezta tilted her head aside, glancing down at her right arm. “So it is. Unfortunate. I can still perform my duties, I assure you.”

“Should I try pushing more magic into you?”

“I do not believe it would help. Thank you for your assistance,” she said with another bow. “Do not worry. It doesn’t hurt.”

“Yeah, but…”

“Master, you were telling me how I could make up this generous donation of your magic.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. “We’re going to talk about this later,” he said, tone leaving no room for argument. “But this is important. Are you in a position to help heal others or do I need to kidnap Abbess Keena?”

“I can assist.”

“Good. Ilya and several of the orcs were injured in the fight. I patched up Ilya with Flesh Weaving but there are others who could use your ministrations. The worst of the orcs have been petrified by one of the gorgon until we have time to help them.”

“Understood. If you would please transport me to the worst of them, I will get started immediately.”

Arkk wasn’t sure who had it the worst at the moment. Instead, he sent her to Ilya. They could figure out where to go from there.

He didn’t go back with her. Standing with a sigh, he placed a hand over his pocket, feeling the chill against his hip.

“Time to go confront a raging fire monster,” he said with a mild sigh.

Hopefully, this ice marble worked.

## 49 - The Flame Witch


Arkk didn’t consider himself the smartest person around. Well-read—or at least as well-read as a small village farmboy could get—and knowledgeable about the world from his frequent conversations with travelers, he thought he was better off than most. There were still many areas in which he knew he had improvements to make. Still, even the biggest idiot in the village would have been able to recognize that teleporting directly in front of a wall of fire capable of turning a door to ash in seconds was a bad idea.

Not wanting to prove himself more of an idiot, Arkk teleported to one of the partially destroyed rooms instead. It was filled with random debris. Enough to make it look like someone might have lived here. Not that anyone even bothered to look into the room. Purifier Agnete had simply walked past the entrance a few minutes ago without so much as a turn of her head. Fires still raged up near the door. The hallway outside was completely destroyed.

It hadn’t been the intention but it was a good thing they had made the little grated tunnels between each room to help disguise the one tunnel that led back to the main fortress. Those little tunnels were the only reason he could count this space as his territory at the moment. Implementing them into the main fortress seemed like a must after everything was over just so that if something similar happened again, he would be able to teleport around the disconnected areas.

For now, however, Arkk had to focus.

Sweat beaded down his face the moment he appeared. When he had pulled the orcs out of the way of the purifier just a second too slow, it felt like he had walked into a blacksmith’s forge. Here, it felt like he had thrown himself into the kiln. Even from across the room, it felt like his exposed skin was being burned and even his clothes were starting to smolder.

The fires were still raging and *that* was what Arkk wanted, intense heat aside. He pulled out the chilly marble, using his sleeve to keep it from directly touching his fingers, and felt immediate relief. The room didn’t turn cold, exactly, but it shifted closer to a hot and stifling day than a kiln. Approaching the red-white glow, he waved the marble around. The flames did fade somewhat but didn’t fully extinguish. They certainly didn’t diminish enough that Arkk would have felt safe going anywhere near the person controlling the fire.

When he had been watching the inquisitors before the ambush, the marble had been floating above Vrox’s hand as he walked along a fair distance behind Agnete. The fires near him had gone out completely and instantly. There was more to this artifact than simply waving it about.

Arkk wasn’t sure how to make the marble float but he could try pushing a little of his magic into it. Just a touch. Like he would with a ritual circle that he really didn’t want to explode.

The temperature around him plummeted. Frost formed on Arkk’s breath as he failed to suppress a shudder. Most important of all, the fires winked out of existence almost immediately.

Teleporting to a room closer to Agnete with far more intense flames, Arkk tried the same thing again. Just a touch of magic sent out a wave of bitter cold that sapped the heat from the room and snuffed out the fire in an instant. Even with his tunic in the way, his fingers still felt numb. Still, that was a minor problem compared to the turbulent flame witch.

Taking a deep breath of the frigid air, Arkk teleported again. This time, he reappeared just in front of the wall of flames in the corridor the purifier was marching down.

The heat from before couldn’t compare. He couldn’t come up with a comparison. What was hotter than a kiln? Hell itself? Demons stoking the flames around his feet?

Gritting his teeth, he poured a little more magic into the marble and *relished* in the winter breeze that blew through the corridor.

He was the only one. Behind an impenetrable wall of flames and heat haze, a blood-curdling scream echoed out. Not a cry of rage or frustration. A cry of fear and terror. One sweeping wave of fire lashed out at Arkk but the ice marble stopped it well before it could reach him. Pouring a little more power into the marble was enough to bring down the fire and the temperature. With a hiss, the haze dispersed.

The purifier wasn’t on her feet. She was on the ground, curled up in a tight ball and shaking violently. It was cold, true, but only enough that Arkk thought he needed a light cloak now that he wasn’t pushing magic into the marble. The purifier’s clothes had burned away, leaving her entirely naked, but even then it wasn’t cold enough to send someone to the ground. Arkk watched a moment. Her eyes, wide and darting back and forth, lacked the glow he had seen in them before. The scars on her face—and the rest of her body—still looked like faint embers underneath her skin but even that was rapidly fading.

Lips pressed together, Arkk teleported away, dropped the marble off on the desk in his room, and then teleported back. He maintained his distance, just in case, but there wasn’t too much danger. He could feel the marble through the [HEART]. It was his property now, meaning he could instantly retrieve it if he ever needed it. For the moment, he didn’t think he did.

The chill in the partially ruined corridor didn’t vanish entirely in the absence of the marble. It did fade. Slowly, at first, but the heat started to come back in short order. Arkk wasn’t sure if that was natural or if the purifier was doing something. Her scars and her eyes were starting to regain their usual glow.

Crouching down, Arkk watched and waited until her violent trembling subsided. She still remained on the ground, curled up, but at least her eyes were snapping back and forth in terror.

What now?

Arkk stared, wondering if he should just leave or perhaps send her back the way she came. Then he recalled Vrox’s words from earlier, how worried the man had been about losing control of Agnete, and the fact that he had called her *that thing*. An idea started to form in Arkk’s mind. A smart idea? Not particularly. Still, if it worked…

“Are you alright?” Arkk asked, raising his voice to be heard from a distance.

The faint embers in the back of her eyes shifted as she locked her gaze on Arkk. It was such a sudden and deliberate shift that he wasn’t sure if she had even noticed him before. She didn’t answer him, however, just sitting on the ground with her arms still wrapped around her legs.

Arkk grabbed a thick blanket from the fortress, teleported forward, dropped it over her, then teleported back. All in the blink of an eye.

She sat up slowly, drawing the blanket around her. Arkk just watched from a distance, thinking to himself.

He wished they had that magic-nullifying prison that Vezta had mentioned. Initially, when he had first come up with the plan to deceive the inquisitors, he had thought to send them all away with the impression that he had abandoned this area.

Now, the purifier brought up some interesting questions and possibilities. If Vezta was right and she was some servant of one of the Pantheon, and not the traitors, that alone made him curious about her. Then, as someone always looking to turn situations to his advantage, Arkk couldn’t dismiss that she was likely a powerful spellcaster. Given that he needed one more powerful caster and their rarity, he couldn’t just look away and let her go without at least *trying*.

The problem was whether or not she was loyal to the inquisitors. He doubted it but that didn’t necessarily mean that she would be up to turning on them. Even with that marble at hand, Arkk wasn’t willing to let such a powerful and destructive person remain anywhere near him. The employment bond would keep her from attacking him without any warning but those flames were destructive enough that even that would make him a little nervous.

Assuming she was open to employment in the first place.

“Are you alright?” Arkk tried again. The purifier didn’t respond. She sat and she stared, leaving Arkk with little to do but sigh. Would he get an honest answer if he simply asked about her loyalty to the inquisitors?

She wasn’t talking at all. He wouldn’t get *any* answer at this rate.

“The inquisitors are back the way you came,” Arkk said, nodding his head down the corridor. “They fell down a pit, lost their ice marble, and while they probably came out ahead in the ambush I set for them, they still lost overall. I doubt they’ll be too happy…”

Arkk trailed off, noting a gradual rise in temperature along with an intensifying glow in the purifier’s eyes. He almost grabbed the marble again but held off for just a moment. It didn’t seem like she was attacking him. She was still on the floor, simmering but hardly moving.

“I get the impression that the inquisitors aren’t too fond of you. They treat you more like an attack dog on a leash, don’t they? Now that they don’t have that leash anymore, what will they do? Lock you up? Kill you?” He paused for a response. Still none came. “I’m really not interested in a conflict with the inquisitors so I’m abandoning this place,” he lied. “Maybe if you went and told them you forced me out, that would grant you some leniency? Or…

“Maybe you would be interested in a change of employer?”

That got an actual reaction out of her. Not much of one. The black shadows of ash around her eyes stretched as her eyebrows quirked upward. Was that interest?

“I have an associate,” Arkk said, hoping he had more to entice her with, “who claims to know where your powers over fire come from. She would be most interested in discussing the matter with you.”

Her lips, darkened like the skin around her eyes, parted. She whispered but it carried. “You hold my leash.”

“True,” Arkk said, not bothering to deny it. “I don’t know you. I don’t know if you’ll go on a rampage the moment you get the chance. It makes obvious sense to have insurance. I don’t know how the inquisitors handled it but if you don’t attack my employees or my property, I see little reason to have to use it.” Pulling a gold coin from his treasury, he held it up. “You’ll also get paid for services rendered. I don’t know what the inquisitors pay you but I’m quite sure I can double it.” Remembering what Vezta said her alleged patron’s name was, the Burning Forge, he added, “We also have a lovely forge set up that we can expand at will if that suits your interests.”

The purifier closed her eyes, breathed out in a way that caused her face to shimmer in the heat haze, and then slowly stood up. She left the blanket dangling loose and open over her shoulders. “You offer no choice.”

“There’s always a choice. Go with the inquisitors. Run away. Try—”

“None are choice. I will be hunted. I will be imprisoned. If they fail to recover my leash, I will be killed.”

“Ah. Well, I’m not willing to give that up.” He held up his gold coin. “Just this.”

“No choice,” she whispered then held out a hand. “I must accept.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. He already had Savren as a mostly unwilling minion. The orcs as well, technically, though he was pretty sure they had gotten over their change in employer. Most had been all too happy to sign up after he killed their old chieftain. Still, he wasn’t too sure that he wanted another reluctant employee. Yet the benefits of having her with him were… too great to ignore. Her fires were strong and her magical capacity *had* to be great enough for the ritual. Besides that, it was an insult to the inquisitors, taking their strongest caster. And, importantly, he didn’t feel that great about sending someone back to them who was just going to be killed for nothing.

Teleporting forward, Arkk placed the golden coin in her outstretched hand. It immediately started to melt in her clutch, drooping around the edges while the maze-like pattern on the face blended into a golden slurry. Bits dripped from between her fingers, splashing to the ground below before she managed to rein herself in. Using both hands, she mushed the semi-solid remains back together and then rolled her palms against each other, eventually opening her hand to reveal a lumpy sphere.

“It was probably worth more as a coin,” Arkk said slowly. They could probably feed it to one of the lesser servants to turn it back into a proper coin.

“Sorry.”

Arkk tested the employee link between them and found it to be secure and snug. He shook his head, dismissing her worry. “It was mostly symbolic. I’m wealthy enough that one coin—”

“What was that?” she whispered, the glow in her eyes deepening as she stared around at the ceiling and walls.

“You felt that? That’s a first.”

As if following some invisible thread in the air, she brought her eyes back down to Arkk. “What did you do?”

“I possess a magical artifact that forms a link between myself and my employees. It primarily lets me teleport you around as I teleport myself around.”

“I feel a strange magic,” she said, looking down at her black fingernails. Arkk wasn’t sure if they were painted black or if they had been burned that way. “Yet… familiar?”

“It does seem to increase the magical capacity of some of the employees.”

“Forbidden magic. Like my own.”

Arkk shrugged at that. “Maybe. I don’t know. Never went to a proper magic academy.” He paused. “Is that a problem?”

“I cannot… It soothes, in some way.” Agnete hesitated for a long moment before shaking her head. “We are already hunted.”

“That is… certainly a way of looking at it. I hope to shake the inquisitors off our tails for now, at least. Buy us some breathing room. If you know of any method of tracking us and how to avoid it, that would be *excellent*.” Arkk beckoned with a hand. “Several were injured in the fight with the inquisitors but my chief warlock made it out alright. I’m sure she would be interested in hearing about how the inquisitors function.”

“I have limited information. Darius does not often involve me in operations.”

“Still, whatever you have is more than we had before.” He paused and then glanced down. “Though maybe we should get you some clothes beforehand. So let’s do that first. I need to take care of the injured and, after, we’ll see about setting you up with some living quarters.”

“Living… quarters?”

“A home? Room to yourself? A place to live.”

“That wasn’t my question. You said you were abandoning this place.”

“Ah.” Arkk’s smile froze in place. “Yes. That is true. *This* place,” he said, pointing at the ground. *Just in case* she planned on betraying him, he didn’t want to tell her absolutely everything just yet. “I’m going to teleport you now so don’t be surprised.”

In the blink of an eye, they reappeared in the tailor room. The one humanoid lesser servant appeared as well, pulled from the false fortress where it had been helping the others dig.

Agnete stared around, eyes roaming over the bolts of cloth in the walls and the machines for making attire. “Forbidden…”

“So I heard. Anyway, this one will get you some clothes. I need to see to my people.” He turned but paused—entirely for effect rather than out of necessity. “Please don’t burn everything down.”

“I shall try.”

Figuring that was as good as he was going to get, Arkk nodded his head and teleported away.

He hadn’t mentioned to *any* of his minions that he could observe them through the employee link. It was a good test, he figured, to watch what she did when left on her own. The ice marble was a thought away, so he would be able to step in before she could manage too much damage. If she did start burning things down, there wasn’t much of value there. The room could be rebuilt with an expenditure of gold and the lesser servant… He would feel bad but better a lesser servant than one of his proper employees.

He reappeared in front of Ilya, who had pulled up her shirt and was prodding some of the black slime left behind by Vezta’s ministrations just above her navel. He thought he had gotten her wound pretty well patched up but Vezta must have disagreed. Noticing him, Ilya quickly tugged the shirt back down and then shot him a glare. Arkk almost chuckled at the difference between the stoic flame witch and the red creeping over Ilya’s cheeks. She hadn’t even pulled her shirt up *that* high. He managed to stop himself before he started, realizing that laughing at her would be a most regrettable mistake.

Instead, he sat down on the chair next to her. “Are you alright?”

“This feels gross and weird,” she said, rubbing the same spot through her clothes. A bit of black trailed from her fingers as she pulled her hand away, making her grimace in disgust. “And it is going to ruin my clothes. Maybe we should look into hiring proper healers?”

“That would mean going to clergy. I don’t think anyone associated with the church is going to be happy working with us.”

“Yeah. Lovely. Can’t there be some bandit priest out there?”

Arkk did laugh at that. “I’ll keep an eye out.”

“The pain is gone, at least. Is it going to be enough for Dakka and the others?”

Arkk turned his head to the still statue of the wounded orc with a frown. “I hope so. Combined with Flesh Weaving, I imagine they’ll be alright. Hurt, yes, but alright.” His eyes lingered on the gaping wound in Dakka’s shoulder before he looked back to Ilya. “In other news, I might have hired that purifier.”

“You… When did you manage that?”

“Just now. She’s getting some clothes with the tailor at the moment.”

Or… something like that. The lesser servant was trying to take measurements but the purifier had started poking and prodding it. Much to the lesser servant’s chagrin. It even tried biting her finger but the purifier just flicked it off. At least nothing was on fire.

Ilya dropped her voice to a hushed whisper, one that even Arkk had to strain to hear. “First the gorgon and now that witch? I hope you know what you’re doing.”

Arkk put on a wide grin. “Ilya, you should know best: I have *no* idea what I’m doing.”

## 50 - Settling In


“And the inquisitors?”

“They look like they just finished their investigation,” Zullie said, peering over the crystal ball. “They didn’t find anything.”

“Not even the teleportation circles?”

“I think those were destroyed when you collapsed the connecting tunnel.”

Frowning, Arkk drummed his fingers on the table. When he collapsed the tunnel, the entirety of the false fortress had lost the magic keeping it going, reverting the claimed territory to loose dirt and rock. A few of the less-stable parts collapsed on their own without the brick walls there to support the weight of the tunnel. The far end held his teleportation circles. Several of them. One went to Silver City and another went to Hope’s Rest. The others were decoys.

In the original plan, before realizing how dangerous Purifier Agnete’s flames actually were, he had been planning on confronting the inquisitors somewhere near the false [HEART] chamber before fleeing to the circles. Each of the six circles led to six more circles which then led to six more. Just to confuse where he had been retreating to. He hadn’t intended to use them, just make it seem like he was using them when he instead teleported back to the main fortress.

It wasn’t a big loss if the inquisitors didn’t find it but it was one more thing that he had planned for that hadn’t worked out. It was irritating but at least he could try that trick in the future if it ever became necessary.

The thought of doing all this again… “Remind me if we ever come under attack again: We *need* to do a lot more research on what our opponents are capable of. While today certainly could have gone worse, it didn’t go *well*.”

“Is that… likely?” Zullie said, shifting in her seat. “I’d rather not go through with something like today again. I like *observing* unique and novel magics. Especially holy magic, which I have almost no experience with. That said, I’m not too interested in being on the receiving end of unique and novel magics. After that inquisitor reflected your bolt of lightning, I locked up, too worried about doing something that would rebound on me.”

Arkk nodded his head, agreeing with that. He hadn’t cast anything after that either. Though, thinking about it now without the adrenaline and chaos of combat, a solution did pop into his mind. “I think things that wouldn’t affect him directly would have worked. A fog in the air that he couldn’t see through maybe. The marble falling and freezing him to the floor worked well enough.”

“I’m most curious about how he was anticipating everything. When you and Dakka started teleporting around him, he moved well in advance of any incoming attacks. Was it magic or battle instinct?”

“I suppose we could ask our new hire,” Arkk said, quickly peeking in on the purifier as she investigated the lair room. He had left her in there well over an hour ago, saying that it would create a home that matched her desires. So far, she hadn’t done anything yet. Either she had no real desires or she was having trouble getting it working. “But let’s hold off on that for now. We’re not going to fight that man in the immediate future. I don’t want anyone around the purifier unless I’m there as well. At least for now.”

Zullie quirked an eyebrow above her violet eyes. “Should I be worried?”

“No idea. All I really know about her is that she has very dangerous, very painful magic and she was just barely our opponent. Until we have a better handle on her personality, I’d rather not take any chances.”

“I don’t recall getting a warning like this about the gorgon.”

Arkk opened his mouth but hesitated, thinking. They were dangerous beings who had been threatening him only minutes before he hired them. Yet… something about them felt *right* under his command. He didn’t know *how* that could be the case. Perhaps it had something to do with what Vezta said. The gorgon were descendants of old allies. They belonged here.

Shrugging, Arkk stood. “I’m going to head out on another set of rounds. Keep watching the inquisitors. Let me know the moment they do anything alarming.”

“They look like they’re packing up. Didn’t spend much time looking for their lost purifier, did they?”

“Not complaining,” Arkk said before teleporting away.

Fortress Al-Mir had not possessed anywhere for the injured to recover before an hour ago. Before now, the only injuries were generally minor things. Usually coming from the orcs in the fighting pits. They were a hardy bunch who were happy to show off their wounds for a while. When they eventually retired for the evening, they tended to themselves in their lairs.

With an expenditure of gold, Arkk had created a large lair room. Whatever magic of the [HEART] let them have their personalized rooms didn’t like anyone having *two* personalized rooms. Still, what he had been able to do was make several beds all in a row. At least the wounded weren’t lying on the cold, hard floors. He would have to come up with another solution in the future.

Lots of things needed to be done in the future.

For now, this was as best as he could do.

Most of the occupied beds were those with moderate injuries. Those with minor injuries had retired to their own lairs. The worst—at least, the worst of those who weren’t petrified—was the orc who had been on the initial receiving end of Purifier Agnete’s flames. Katt’am’s legs looked raw and were covered in blisters. His normally green skin was anything but. If there was one small mercy, it was that he had fallen unconscious.

Arkk didn’t know what to do for the orc. One leg had burns up to his ankle but the other was charred all the way up to his thigh. The latter leg also… didn’t exactly have much of a foot anymore. Arkk had to force himself to look at it, feeling like he shouldn’t shirk away. It was his responsibility. Even still, it made his stomach churn.

Arkk had to breathe through his mouth around the poor orc. He couldn’t imagine being in Katt’am’s position.

These injuries weren’t something that anyone would recover from. The orc’s hardy body wouldn’t help here. Even Abbess Keena wouldn’t have been able to help. As it was, they might have to chop off his other foot and the remainder of his leg before they started rotting.

Maybe one of the church’s healers would have an idea. The nearby burgs had larger church buildings with higher-ranking members of the church. If they had any ideas for how to handle such burn injuries, it was his duty to seek them out. Though he might not be able to go himself. It would probably be best if he avoided the nearby burgs and villages until the inquisitors had left the area. Or at least until his eyes stopped glowing. He was trying to calm down, but…

Arkk turned away from Katt’am and moved about the room. He made sure to speak with everyone who had taken an injury if for no other reason than to reassure them that he was doing everything he could. In reality, Vezta was the one who had done most of the heavy lifting. The slime she left didn’t magically make everything better but it did seal wounds and, speaking from experience, seemed to accelerate the healing process. Arkk had used Flesh Weaving to shore up the worst of the wounds.

Stopping at the statue of Dakka, Arkk frowned. He wasn’t sure that Vezta would be enough for the gash in her shoulder. She had looked rather pale before her petrification too. Could he use Flesh Weaving on her fast enough? It wasn’t exactly a spell designed for emergency use. Nor for deep wounds. It was slow and clunky, requiring a great deal of concentration just to put things back together.

Maybe the church could help with that as well?

It was something to investigate now rather than later.

Teleporting away, Arkk found the one man who he felt would be able to get into and out of the burgs without drawing too much attention.

John looked up from a long piece of timber and the adze he was using to smooth one side of it. It was a long beam with a shallow bend cut in the middle. Maybe a truss for a roof? Arkk wasn’t sure what he was working on at the moment and Hale wasn’t around so it wasn’t a lesson for his apprentice. Given the situation, Arkk didn’t think about it too hard.

“Did your work go well?” John asked before Arkk could speak.

“Somewhat. The inquisitors seem to be leaving,” Arkk said, focusing on the positives of the situation.

“So we can go home?”

Arkk hesitated, considering. “We should probably keep an eye on them for a little longer. As long as they don’t look like they’re coming back, I don’t think it would be a problem. Though I would ask that you not tell anyone I’m out here. I tried to give the inquisitors the impression that I’m abandoning this area. Maybe running off to one of the principalities. That mostly means no telling Abbess Keena.”

“Ah. I’ll admit, I’ll miss some of these tools but it will be nice to get back home.”

Shrugging, Arkk said, “I don’t mind if you take them. The fortress can make more. It isn’t like we have another carpenter around anyway. But before you start packing them up, I came here wondering if you might do me a favor.”

“Oh?”

“We had some injuries with the orcs. One has severe burns and another few have deep gouges and cuts. I was wondering if you would be willing to head into one of the burgs and see if you can’t ask some of the church healers for advice. Don’t say what we were doing. Maybe just say that someone was drunk and fell into a firepit… but any help we can get would be appreciated. We don’t have any proper healers down here.”

The old carpenter drew himself up, squaring his shoulders. “I don’t know that I rightly trust those orcs. You do remember that *they* attacked *us*, don’t you?” he started, holding up a hand when Arkk tried to object. “But you’ve done right by me over the years and kept Hale out of those inquisitors’ hands. I’d be happy to help.”

“Thanks,” Arkk said, giving him a firm clap on the shoulder. “I’m going to teleport you to the end of the Smilesville tunnel. You know how to get out?”

“Sure do.”

“Just make something up about being from a nearby village. I mostly need help with burn wounds but one of my orcs has a deep gash from her shoulder to her breast,” Arkk said, dragging a hand down his chest in roughly the right spot before handing over a small sack of gold pulled from the treasury. “Help for that would be appreciated.”

“I’ll see what I can do.”

“Thank you,” Arkk said again before teleporting John away without further delay. The longer they waited, the worse things would get. At least for Katt’am. Dakka and the others should be fine until they removed the petrification. Perhaps Katt’am would appreciate being petrified as well.

With that set in motion, Arkk did a quick scan around the rest of his fortress. Larry, under his orders, was preparing a large feast for everyone able to attend. Something of an apology and thanks for the effort put into stopping the inquisitors. Ilya, Rekk’ar, and Olatt’an were having a discussion just outside the new medical wing. It looked like a fairly serious meeting. Arkk wasn’t sure what they were talking about but he figured one of them would fill him in. He didn’t really want to get into a talk with the two orcs—or, at least, Rekk’ar—at the moment. He doubted the orc would have much positive to say. Vezta was working her way around the infirmary, fixing up an orc who was clearly not enjoying her slathering black tar on his waist.

Hale…

Arkk blinked twice before teleporting to the library. He immediately snatched a black book out of her hands and scowled down at its cover.

“Hey!”

“What do you think you’re doing, young lady?”

“Practicing reading like Zullie said.”

“Where did you get this?” he asked, slapping a hand against the cover of the book he had taken from the former orc chieftain. “I thought this was in my room.”

Hale shrugged and pointed just past the still statue of Savren to one of the shelves. “It was right over there. I remembered looking through it and wanted to see if I could read it now.”

Arkk frowned at Savren. “I forgot about you,” he mumbled under his breath before looking at the shelf. The indicated shelf held many books. Mostly Zullie’s. If that witch had left this one lying about where Hale could find it…

“Read *other* books, Hale.”

“*Arkk*,” she *whined*. “That one had *cool* spells in it. Not the lame rituals Zullie has been teaching me.”

“She’s teaching you the foundations. You need to start there or you’ll end up like me, blowing up half the things you try to do.”

Hale huffed, crossing her arms across her chest. She started grumbling under her breath, complaining about how unfair it was that *he* got to use the good spells. Aside from Flesh Weaving, Arkk didn’t think there was much *good* in the book. For a moment, he considered teaching Hale to use the spell. Having another person capable of providing aid wouldn’t be a bad idea. Perhaps she wouldn’t be so upset if he did so.

He had deliberately kept the book away from Zullie even though the spell would have been useful for her as well.

“What’s up with that thing anyway?” Hale asked.

Looking up at Savren, Arkk frowned. With the orcs petrified, that could wait a little longer. He probably shouldn’t leave one of his minions in that state unnecessarily.

Pulling one of Zullie’s beginner books off the shelves, Arkk handed it over to Hale. “Practice reading with this.”

“But—”

Hale didn’t get to finish before he teleported her back to her room. In her place, Zharja appeared, staring right at the statue of Savren. The gorgon stared for a brief moment before letting out a ferocious hissing. The black-scaled snake whipped her head toward him.

She froze when she met glowing red eyes.

“I apologize for disturbing you,” Arkk said as calmly as he could, trying to ignore the knot in his stomach at locking his gaze on her slit pupils. As much as he felt like the gorgon belonged here… they were still gorgon. “Would you mind turning him back to normal? I’ll send you back to your rock afterward.”

Zharja stuck her tongue out, tasting the air. “Very well,” she hissed, turning her hooded head over to Savren. Unless he wanted Savren to suffer from an accident sooner or later, keeping all the gorgon far away from him jumped up on Arkk’s list of priorities

Arkk felt a faint pulse of magic from her before the smooth marble cracked and broke. Flesh, hair, and cloth appeared underneath, looking entirely unharmed.

“—get you, you slimy—” Savren, blinking three times rapidly, looked to Arkk and then turned a nasty snarl on Zharja. “You!”

Arkk teleported Zharja away before any altercation could break out. That made Savren blink again before the man shook his head, throwing bits of rapidly dispersing marble dust out of his hair.

“You mind telling me what you did that got you petrified?”

“What *I* did?” Savren said, glaring but not looking half as angry as he had a moment ago. “I was minding my own business. You said I could browse the books so I was browsing. Zharja slithered in on her slimy scales, stared at me, then sentenced me to stone without a single sentence. She was always the most disobedient and disrespectful, often she deigned to disregard my directivess.”

“You don’t have to hiss your words.”

“Habit,” Savren snapped. “And now she deigns to disobey *your* directives.” He paused, frowning. “Unless you so cruelly condemned me to concretion. I’ve nary a notion to enact negative action,” he said. A heartbeat passed before he added, “Since entering your *enterprising* employ.”

Arkk let out a withering sigh. “I’ll talk to her. I don’t want my employees fighting.”

“Employees? Ha.”

“I pay you, don’t I?”

“What good is gold when it can’t be spent? Your orcs might be content with chancing on combat and your snakes find satisfaction in simple needs but *Savren* strives for status and skill!”

“I don’t…” Arkk trailed off a moment then he put on a sarcastic smile. “You won’t persist on my payroll permanently,” he said. “Partake of your pay without provocation and we’ll part ways with you prosperous enough to… relocate to a new region and start anew?” He hesitated a moment before saying, “See, I can do it too.”

“Pathetic peasant, though you posit a potent point.”

Arkk’s smile slipped. “Is there a reason you talk like this?”

Irritation flashed across Savren’s face. “A caster, crude and cretinous, cursed my cranium to confound my communication. I can fight through it,” he said with a grimace. A blood vein on his temple started to bulge as he drew in a fresh breath of air. “Fight it to cast spells. But speaking simple sentences starting with same-sounds shrinks the strain. If you wish for me to speak ‘normally’ then I… dare say that…” He ground his teeth together like he was chewing something particularly unpleasant.

“Alright, alright. Just stop. You can talk however you want.”

Savren smiled like he had just snatched success from some one-sided struggle. “My mind-magic mastery comes not from merriment in manipulation but from a desire to mend my mental malfunction.”

Arkk shook his head back and forth with his eyes closed. He opened his eyes, trying not to glower at the mesmer. “Just take your pay. I know I’m paying you a whole lot more than you would get doing just about anything else. After I’m done with you, you can go start a new life somewhere else with it all. Maybe pay some academy to look into your… *condition*.”

Arkk wasn’t quite sure if he was telling the truth about that. Letting Savren go, with all he had done, didn’t exactly sound like the wisest idea in the world. As upsetting as that curse might have been, he probably had done something to deserve it. The ritual at the village of Hope had been an experiment. In Savren’s words, diffusion and dissemination of deleterious delusions to dampen the effect. Arkk hadn’t understood what he meant at the time and had been too irritated to ask or even think much about it, but now…

“The ritual at Hope… that was supposed to spread your curse out among the entire village?”

“It functioned, for a fortnight. Freedom from flowing phrases felt fantastic. Until it failed. Fractures formed and families fell. I feared the worst and fled.”

“Leaving the villagers to their fate.”

“To be fair, had I found myself felled along with my fellows, another finding the focal point would have been far-fetched.”

Arkk shook his head. No, letting Savren go free was not a good idea at all. The man cared nothing for the lives he had affected. “Try not to cause trouble,” Arkk said, stepping away. “I’ve got more pressing matters to do.”

Rather than allow Savren time to respond, Arkk immediately teleported in front of a rather warm door. He knocked twice and waited.

The door creaked open of its own accord, letting out a rush of heated air. It wasn’t hot enough to burn Arkk’s face off, being about on par with a dry summer’s day, but it was mildly uncomfortable. Stepping into the room, he looked around and found himself surprised that his face *wasn’t* melting off.

Purifier Agnete sat in a chair made from black stone. It had no cushions and no padding. Just hard black stone. The stone wasn’t whole. Large cracks ran through it, seemingly glued together by some kind of molten rock glowing from within. The bed just to the side of the chair was much the same, black stone with glowing cracks and no padding. No blankets either, not that Arkk thought anyone would need blankets in this room—he was already sweating. The most interesting, and concerning, aspect of the room wasn’t the clearly molten furniture, it was where the furniture was located. The floor, made from the same black stone, didn’t reach all the way to the walls. Aside from a bridge-like path leading to the door, it was floating on a lake of bubbling, molten metal.

The room wasn’t half as hot as the forge and was nowhere near the temperature needed to melt metal, so it had to be some kind of magical construct generated by Fortress Al-Mir. Still, it was a bit unnerving. Arkk wondered how hot it would be if he touched it but wasn’t quite brave enough to try. They had enough problems with burn wounds as it was without adding more on top of it.

“Agnete,” Arkk said, looking at the woman. She wore a black long coat quite reminiscent of the outfits the inquisitors wore, though she wore no boots or footwear of any kind. He wasn’t sure how long it would last, though. The hem looked like someone had dragged it through a campfire. “I see you’re settled in. Need anything?”

“The magic here is…”

“Forbidden, yes, you mentioned.”

“Soothing,” she said, casting her gaze around the molten room. “And forbidden.”

“Yes, well… I was curious… If your fires injured someone, is there anything you can do to help?”

“Help?”

“Any healing or… unburning?”

“I burn, not heal.”

“Yeah, I figured,” Arkk mumbled. “What did the inquisitors do with someone if they wound up partially burned?”

“Interrogation. After, I would be called in to finish the incineration.”

“Okay. That’s… not an option. Things are going to be a bit different here, it seems.”

“I understand.”

Arkk wasn’t sure that she did but wasn’t going to try to explain things now. “I have my chef preparing meals. Would you like one once they are ready?”

“Yes.”

“Alright. I’ll be back later then. Feel free to… relax?”

She nodded, sweeping her fingers through her wild black hair. Arkk almost teleported away but hesitated, watching her for just a moment longer. The cuff of her sleeve was smoldering.

Those clothes weren’t going to last long at all.

Arkk teleported away.

## 51 - Inquisition Expedition Aftermath


Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox limped across his temporary office within the Grand Old Church of Cliff City, slung a pack onto his desk, and sunk low into an old wooden chair. Not the most comfortable of accommodations. Still, he appreciated what little reprieve on his aching muscles the chair provided. One would think that returning to Cliff in his carriage would have provided ample opportunity to rest. He had sat for most of the journey. Travel, however, had a way of draining energy. Especially when it left him alone with idle thoughts, forcing him to confront one unpleasant fact after another as he reflected on the debacle in the Cursed Forest.

He was a rusted blade.

It wasn’t always this way. Fifteen years ago, when he had been scouted for and invited into the ranks of the Light’s Inquisitors, he had been a one-man army. An exaggeration to be sure, but he held little doubt that he would have been able to fight off all of Arkk’s orcs without too much trouble even without the help of Douglas. At some point, that changed. He had a feeling that he knew when, where, and why.

His own competence was his downfall. The Inquisitors did not have a tall hierarchy. Nevertheless, he had risen through it rapidly. In five years, he had been made Master Inquisitor. Along with that new title came assignees under his command. Namely the Purifier Agnete. From the moment she had been placed in his cell, his role had changed. No longer was he a fighter. He became an investigator. He lurked around, discovered plots and plans, and then rather than take care of matters himself, he threw the Purifier at them.

And why not? Her powers were monstrous beyond human comprehension. None could stand up to her flames and live.

When was the last time he had been forced to fight like that? Sure, he flung a few spells here or there and had always considered himself above average with a longsword but…

Darius removed his boots, letting him stretch out his feet.

He didn’t get much relaxation in before a knock at his office door disturbed him. Quickly, Darius sat fully upright and straightened his uniform. He pulled a stack of papers from his desk and a pen and started writing. “Enter,” he said, barely cognizant of the tip of the pen scraping across the paper.

Chronicler Douglas Greesom stepped into the room. Douglas had not come out unscathed from their adventures either. In fact, Douglas had the worse wound. His arm, wrapped tight and held in a sling, had been tended to by the local priest and abbess of Stone Hearth Burg, however, it would be quite some time before he was fully back to normal. The blow he had received from the orc’s axe had shattered his forearm.

Darius wasn’t sure if it was luck, skill, or divine intervention, but whatever the case, he was thankful that Douglas had only contacted with the *haft* of the axe and not the blade. Bone was harder to mend than a flesh wound but losing an arm entirely would have been permanent. In truth, both of them had escaped with relatively little harm. Something he probably owed to Arkk, disquieting as that notion might sound.

The presence of Douglas put Darius at ease—letting him drop his pen and cease the act of the ultra-dedicated inquisitor.

That ease quickly shifted to unease as Darius took in the stiff appearance of Douglas.

“I have concluded my report to the Ecclesiarch.”

Darius flicked his eyes to the golden necklace dangling around Douglas’ chest. The Ecclesiarch, barring unexpected movements, was down in the Bastion City, a star-shaped fortification nestled between three lakes in the middle of a desert. The capital of the Kingdom of Chernlock, home of the Temple of the Light, and the seat of power over the entire region. With the angled pendant on Chronicler Greesom’s necklace, resembling a mixture of the Three Symbols of Light, Douglas could receive revelation, power advanced miracles, and even commune with people in a location *months* of travel away.

It was a rare artifact, only wieldable by those with training in miracle usage. Chroniclers like Greesom did not grow on trees, though they were marginally more common than purifiers like Agnete.

“You spoke to the Ecclesiarch himself? Not an aide?”

“The Ecclesiarch is intensely interested in our operation and wished to hear the report in person.”

“Wonderful,” Darius said, removing his glasses as he began rubbing the bridge of his nose. “He was… displeased?”

Douglas snorted an ugly laugh. “Light protects. Between losing the Binding Agent and allowing our purifier to go rogue, it is a wonder we weren’t met at the gates by other inquisitors ready to clamp chains on our wrists. He already knew before I even had a chance to speak.”

“Sometimes I wonder why we spend all this time writing reports.” Darius reseated the glasses on his nose and looked over Douglas. “Well? I presume we’re off the job?”

“Not quite.”

“Oh?”

“The Oracles are growing increasingly concerned. An event, the details of which I was not made privy to, occurred just after we lost the Binding Agent to Arkk. To quote the Ecclesiarch: ‘The Stars have begun to churn and broil.’” Douglas shook his head. “I don’t know exactly what that means.”

“A being from beyond the stars and churning stars? I would say there is a connection there.”

“Indeed. Unfortunately,” Douglas said with a shrug, “we will not be receiving reinforcements or a replacement for Agnete. There is… something else going on. The Golden Order of Evestani has ceased communication with the Temple of the Light. The Ecclesiarch is concerned. It seems as if the other inquisitorial cells are being rerouted to Bastion.”

“The Golden Order… their order was the power behind the war, was it not?”

Douglas dipped his head in agreement. “We are not being recalled. Our directive is to recapture or kill our lost purifier in the hopes of that shifting event being reverted or stalled. Priority on the *being* remains high though not quite as high as Agnete. I dare say faith in our ability to handle it has been diminished.”

“I see. Presuming Arkk has taken control of Agnete—” A fairly safe assumption given the lack of a conflagration consuming the central Duchy. “—our objective has hardly changed. We track him down and he leads us to the purifier.”

“We are more aware of what we face. Losing Agnete is problematic but we know her capabilities and have countermeasures for her, albeit less effective than the Binding Agent.”

“Indeed,” Darius agreed. “The orcs pose little problem. I shall have to refresh my memory of a few choice spells.”

“The Light protects. Gorgon will not be a problem either.”

“That just leaves Arkk, the strange abilities he demonstrated, and his pet horror from beyond the stars.”

Douglas nodded his head. “An opportunity for redemption beyond the handling of Agnete?”

“We focus on our primary directive, of course. *If* the opportunity of which you speak presents itself, who are we to ignore it?” Darius stood and cracked his neck from side to side. The sensation of fatigue vanished from his bones, replaced with a sense of renewed purpose. “Your injuries,” he said, looking at the broken arm of his chronicler. “Were you told how long they would take to heal?”

“Optimistically, three months. It is my hope that the local bishop can keep that optimistic schedule on pace.”

“Very well. Three months. Not a lot of time but time enough.”

“Sir?”

“I have been lax,” Darius said, stalking over to the window of his office, looking out over the city of Cliff. “Too reliant on the powers of a monster to fight my battles for me.

“It is time we change that.”

***

*And so we arrived late in the evening. The hired orcs were most efficient and eager to put down the local wildlife threatening our camp. They were invaluable throughout the expedition in keeping the rest of the crew safe. You have my compliments.*

*Upon dawn the next morning, we approached the ruins for the first time. To our great surprise, they were hardly ruins at all. Preserved through the ages, the black marble displayed little evidence of any erosion or deliberate harm. The ziggurat’s smooth walls looked as if they had been freshly carved by stone masons a mere week ago. Yet, through the means detailed in my notes, I was able to determine the age of the structure to be approximately eight hundred years. Not quite the pre-Calamity ruins I had been hoping for but still a significant historical find.*

*The first week, we spent our time solely examining the exterior of the structure. We took measurements and fully examined the ziggurat. It turned out to be much larger than my research would have indicated. I am unsure how the ancients managed to build it, even now. There were no seams or evidence of assembly. The pyramid appeared entirely carved from a single stone. The highlands where we discovered it contained no other black marble in the area leaving the source of the material’s origin a mystery.*

*It was with deep and profound regret that we believed our expedition to be at an end then and there. With the pyramid being a single, uniform structure with no openings and no designs leading to clues as to its purpose, we thought to pack up camp and head home. It was one of your orcs that proved invaluable in discovering the way forward. The evening before we were set to depart, Gratt’an stumbled across a similarly designed slab of stone a mild distance from the pyramid itself. This slab was not one uniform monolith but, instead, a* door.

*With the aid of all five orcs and several of the workers we brought along, we managed to pry open the door and breach the interior.*

*What we found was unlike anything I have witnessed in my thirty-nine years. A complex labyrinth of corridors and rooms. Most were, regrettably, empty. Their contents decayed beyond any reasonable identification. The full details are attached but I will call special attention to three rooms in particular. One, a room with a large crystalline archway, covered in strange patterns and designs. I have shipped off sketches of the designs to the Cliff Academy in the hopes of uncovering the nature or purpose of the archway—I am not a spellcaster myself nor were any on our expedition—but they have yet to return my missives. I will send another letter to you with their results if they ever come.*

*Another of the rooms of interest was a simple octagonal chamber containing nothing but a deep pit leading far into the mountain. Although we made efforts to discover where the pit led, we were unsuccessful. We brought with us an excess of rope in the anticipation of requiring it and yet it was not enough to reach the bottom. Combined with a lack of volunteers—many of our work crew found the pit eerie and unsettling—we were forced to leave it alone for the time being.*

*The final room was, I believe based on the maps we created, the interior of the great pyramid that began this whole endeavor. Hollow, the interior walls were covered with thin plates of gold pressed into the walls, forming a massive mural. Attached are sketches but I must confess that they are embarrassingly inadequate compared to witnessing the actual room in person. I am sure that interpretations of the mural will continue for decades among my colleagues but I thought I would offer my view of the events depicted.*

*It begins with sixteen stars hanging in the sky, arranged in an even, equal circle. There are people, humans—possibly also demihumans and beastmen—worshiping the stars. Perhaps icons of an ancient religion, now long dead. All seems peaceful until three of the stars fell away from the others.*

*The early portions of the mural depict death and destruction. Life withering away, the sky falling to the ground, civilizations collapsing to dust. Given the Calamity occurred only a few hundred years prior to this structure’s construction, I am certain that those portions of the mural are depicting the fall of magic and the destruction wrought during those trying times.*

*There appears to be a brief period of rebuilding following that collapse. It wasn’t a long time. Rather than fall prey to another Calamity, however, it seems that man fought against man. Wars erupted among various tribes. A depiction of what I believe to be a dwarf dominated a significant portion of the mural, being killed off by the spears of one of the armies. This might represent a leader falling or, possibly, represents the time the dwarves went extinct. Supporting evidence for the latter includes depictions of several other species, few of whom I recognize, also being killed off.*

*It is well known that many magically sensitive species perished in the Calamity and its aftermath. However, most scholars agree that they went extinct due to the lack of magic. The mural seems to indicate that they were killed off. This contradicts everything we believe about the era. If my interpretations are correct, of course. As I said, these are just my preliminary thoughts, shared with you since you expressed an interest in the outcome of this expedition. I am unsure of the truth of the depicted events or the interpretation.*

*Unfortunately, the mural ends abruptly. There were no signs of battle within the pyramid or the rest of the structure. No remains left behind or anything indicating where the people inhabiting the pyramid went. It is possible they abandoned the location, fought in one of the depicted wars elsewhere, or even lost the technology or expertise required to continue updating their mural.*

*Nevertheless, this mural is a most wonderous find. Following the Calamity, recordkeeping and chronicling fell to almost nothing, leaving the era as a Lost Age. This is, I believe, the most complete record ever discovered of the era and yet it was discovered without written word to confirm what the imagery depicts.*

*Per our agreement, I have spent the last month compiling my notes. You may find the finer details beyond the above summary attached to this missive. If you are interested in more details, additional interpretation of the ruins, or further discussion, you may write to me or visit me directly in the Bastion City. I make my home at the Archives and Museum of National History.*

*Thank you for your support in this expedition, Mister Arkk and Company Al-Mir.*

*Ramis Phonk, Historical Curator of the Crown.*

***

Pale, milky eyes turned away from the twinkling stars in the night sky.

Wind and snow ravaged the Forlorn Mountain’s peak. A harsh, biting cold that would send most mortal races to an early, frosty grave. Even the mighty bonfire of the Hightop Shrine, ever burning with a dragon’s heart at its core, did little to ward off the chill. Yet Priscilla stood from her meditative cushion without the slightest tremble, unfeeling of the harsh snow.

Bare feet stepped around the bonfire until Priscilla stood at the very edge of the Hightop Shrine. Sightless eyes looked down the side of the mountain, spotting the faint lights from the fires of the village at the base. She stepped forward until her black toenails hung just over the edge. Taking a breath, Priscilla leaped forward.

The sheer cliff face rushed past as Priscilla dove. The gale around her felt almost calm and serene as it carried her along, letting her skim past the rocky surface. As the lights in the distance grew larger and the ground grew closer, onyx-scaled wings spread out behind Priscilla, turning her freeform dive into a controlled descent. Gliding in lazy circles over the village, she eventually reached the ground. Priscilla’s feet touched down in the shallow snow just outside the smallest hut in the village.

Taking a step, Priscilla’s foot slammed into something cold and hard. Metallic clanging skipped across the ground even as she hissed at the mild pain of stubbing her toe. Whatever she kicked slammed into the side of the hut with enough force to shatter a plank of wood.

She *heard* a door swing open.

“Who—What? Pris? What are you—*Hide your wings*,” a shocked and confused voice *demanded*.

Priscilla’s sightless eyes looked up to find the burning heart of a woman standing before her. Her lips parted into a smile filled with sharp teeth. “No. No need to hide.”

“No need? Pris… Have the centuries finally driven you mad? You’ll attract poachers.” The burning heart approached and Priscilla felt a comforting arm settle over her shoulders as the other woman ushered her inside the hut. “What are you doing down here? You can’t stand the humans.”

“We’re leaving.”

“Pris, please. I can carry you back up the mountain—”

“No. I won’t go back. The stars have begun to change. Can you not feel it as well? The ancient magics are stirring.”

The burning heart in front of Priscilla shuddered with her words. “I… You’ve *seen* it?”

“I’ve seen the stars, yes.”

“You’ve claimed this before.”

“Twice.”

“Both times, wars started. *We* died. Fought for nothing.” The burning heart turned away. “Nothing changed.”

“Nothing will change unless those who can make the change act.”

The burning heart turned back in a bout of anger. “That is clearly not *us*.”

“Perhaps. Perhaps not. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t *try*.”

“I… I won’t do it. Not again.”

Priscilla blinked, milky eyes trailing after that burning heart. “Pardon?”

“There are so few of us left. Throwing ourselves away chasing the past? We’ve tried—”

“You… are abandoning the pact?”

“Pact?” The burning heart scoffed. “What pact? A pact needs cosigners. We’re all that’s left.”

Priscilla stared at the burning heart, watching the flames coil and twist. Pain and anguish, hope and despair…

Priscilla stood and turned away. “I see.”

“Do you?”

“Of course I—” Taking a step, Priscilla’s nose slammed into a wooden pillar within the hut. “Oof.”

“Pris. Go back to your mountaintop. Please. If… if this turns out—”

“You’ve lived with these humans long enough,” Priscilla said, rubbing her nose. “They have been a bad influence on you.”

“You… won’t harm them. Not without going through me.”

Priscilla turned her head, raising an eyebrow. “Cute that you think you can stop me.”

“Pris!”

“But I won’t.” Reaching out her hands, Priscilla felt around the small hut until her fingers found the door latch. “I can think of no greater punishment for one such as you than to live among humans. Enjoy your time.” Priscilla threw open the door, barely feeling the cold bite of the bitter weather against her scales. “Or, should I say, enjoy *their* time.”

Slamming the door shut hard enough to knock snow off the rooftop, Priscilla turned her gaze around the human village. This late at night, everyone was indoors. Probably. No one was there to see her wings spread wide. Probably. She took off to the skies where she made a lazy circle around the village, picturing a glacier of ice sliding into place, entombing the entire habitation for just a moment before angling her flight off to the west.

Or… did she need to be going to the east?

Priscilla swung her flight around and immediately faceplanted into a tree. Sliding down the trunk, she landed flat on her back. She stayed there for a long moment, staring up at the burning stars overhead.

“This,” Priscilla said, frosty breath escaping her lips, “might be hard without help.”

## 52 - Reassessment


“I want more.”

“Water?” Vezta asked, leaning over Arkk’s shoulder.

“Everything,” Arkk said, hands slamming against the top of the meeting room table as he stood up.

“I see. I shall see if the kitchens are well stocked. If you’ll excuse me…”

“What?” Arkk waved her off, motioning for her to remain where she was. “No. I’ve just had a realization in the last few days. We can’t continue as we are.”

Arkk looked around the meeting room. All his advisors were present. Ilya sat to his immediate right while Vezta stood just a step behind his seat. Rekk’ar and Olatt’an sat around the circular table toward the right, the former with his arm still in a sling from the battle a few days ago. Zullie was to Arkk’s left. Her eyes had been cast down toward a notebook in her lap until Arkk slammed the table. Khan stood across the table from Arkk, all the other members still giving him a wide berth.

He had considered inviting Agnete but… he still wasn’t quite sure about the former inquisitor. She had agreed to join him so easily that he half expected her to be a spy.

It had taken a few days for the realization to fully set in. He had been busy running around, making sure everyone was as healed as could be, making sure the inquisitors weren’t coming back for round two—they had stuck around for a little over a week, resting and recuperating at Smilesville Burg while perhaps watching to see if Agnete would try to burn down the region—and generally putting out the fires around the fortress. Not literal fires, thankfully—Agnete had hardly left her room since arriving—but there had been some minor discord among the orcs. Word had gotten out that the flame witch was in Fortress Al-Mir. Some thought she was a prisoner, some wanted revenge for what she did to one of their own. Under other circumstances, Arkk would have applauded the comradery they were showing, which he felt they might have been lacking under their former chieftain, but here and now, it was yet another thing to deal with.

He still wasn’t sure what to do about Katt’am. The man’s injuries were severe and the local abbeys had been unable to assist. John had agreed to venture to Darkwood to see if he might be able to purchase any aid from the alchemist, Morford. Arkk doubted the man’s alchemy would be able to bring back the orc’s feet but maybe it would help with the pain.

Once he had found a moment to reflect, his mind kept going back to the one thing he felt had slipped by without the reaction it deserved. It wasn’t anything to do with the inquisitors or how Vrox had suggested they put aside their differences long enough to get Agnete under control. It had nothing to do with an avatar of one of Vezta’s [PANTHEON] walking among them. It didn’t even have anything to do with the fact that Vezta still didn’t have an arm from the elbow down.

Arkk was trapped here. The [HEART] was *his* heart. If it stopped beating… If those inquisitors brought in a dozen purifiers… If they rallied the Duke and got the Duke’s Grand Guard sent to purge the fortress… The only defense Arkk had was a handful of spells, a cadre of orcs and gorgons, and a pre-Calamity artifact that wasn’t even functioning properly. It was no small thing. Fending off the inquisitors with Purifier Agnete and their strange holy magic had proved that beyond any doubt.

But it wasn’t enough.

“I need more personnel, more magic, more weapons, more knowledge. *Everything*.”

“Finally,” Rekk’ar grumbled. Arkk shot him a questioning look, prompting a shrug from the green-skinned orc. “The Chieftain had me by the balls,” he said, louder. “Didn’t enjoy that much but working for a limp-dicked farm boy wasn’t much better.” He turned, glowering at Olatt’an.

The older orc simply smiled.

“So,” Rekk’ar said, leaning forward. “How are we becoming a force to be feared?”

Arkk looked around the room, stopping his gaze briefly on each of the others in the room. He honestly had no idea. That was what this meeting was for. Saying that would probably not go over well with Rekk’ar, however. Instead, he looked to Zullie. “First,” he started, “something that can help without doing much else…”

He held out a hand. Retrieving the black book from his private quarters, he placed it down on the table. Both Olatt’an and Rekk’ar stiffened at the sight of it. Olatt’an in particular lost his placid expression. Had he tusks, Arkk imagined he would have been bearing them in full at the moment. Arkk was counting on what trust he had managed to garner with them over the last few months to keep them calm until he fully explained.

“This book formerly belonged to the orc’s old chieftain,” Arkk explained for Zullie’s benefit. “It has a number of distinctly unpleasant spells and rituals within. But it is also where I learned the Flesh Weaving spell.”

“I had wondered…” Zullie said, not reaching for the book but very much looking like she wanted to.

“Look through it. See if there is anything useful that I turned a blind eye to. Make sure you learn the Flesh Weaving spell.” Arkk paused then added, “Teach it to Hale as well, but make sure the book stays out of her hands.”

“Arkk!” Ilya said, admonishing in her tone.

“It’s just the healing spell. If I’m not around, having Zullie and Hale as backups could be the difference between life and death for someone.”

“Still…”

Arkk shook his head and then looked back to Zullie. “Keep this out of Savren’s hands as well,” he said.

“Didn’t even need to say that,” Zullie said, reaching for the book.

As soon as her hands touched the cover, Arkk clamped his hand around her wrist. One more warning occurred to him. “And Zullie, this book contains instructions for demon summoning. We are *not* summoning demons. Am I understood?”

“Y-yes,” she said, nodding her head. “I understand.”

“Good.” Arkk smiled. “That taken care of—”

“Do you mind if I read the demon summoning portions? Purely for reference. The planar magic involved might…” She took a deep breath and let it out in a thin sigh. “There is something you should be aware of regarding the ritual.”

“Oh?”

“Savren found the model we were using. He figured out its purpose and… well, made a few comments that I shouldn’t ignore because of the source.” She paused again, waiting for Arkk to nod his head. “He expressed to me his concern over the catastrophic collision of conceptual corporeality owing to our count of casters charging the catalytic array.”

Arkk stared, giving Zullie a flat look. “He is bad enough. Don’t start as well.”

“Sorry. It’s just… when I designed the ritual array, I thought it best if we err on the side of caution. Overcharge the array to ensure we punch a hole into reality. But we’re not trying to punch a hole into reality. We just need to weaken the boundaries enough that the archway can connect to a different plane. *It* will punch a hole as it was designed to do. Us doing so could have… potentially less desirable outcomes.”

Arkk rubbed his forehead, closing his eyes. “So it won’t work?”

“It will, I wasn’t *wrong*,” she insisted. “It just might be best if we reduce the personnel count. Savren and I were thinking about redesigning the ritual from twenty-five personnel—you, the four higher quality casters at the corners, then five between each of us—to a mere thirteen. You and the cardinal directions will still be required but we reduce the ancillary members to eight in total, two on each side.”

“That’s…” Arkk looked up, eyebrows raised. “That’s good. Right? We could perform the ritual immediately.”

“Ah. Not quite. Previously, I cleared several of the orcs for duty on the sides. I failed to account for one small problem. The magic that allows Dakka to cast your lightning bolt spell comes from *you*. You’ll be needing that power yourself. We need to find middling-average quality casters capable independent of you.”

“So basically nothing has changed then.”

“Correct. I just thought you should be aware.”

Olatt’an cleared his throat, drawing attention to himself. At a nod from Arkk, he asked, “What, exactly, are we expecting from the outcome of this ritual?”

“Well,” Arkk started, then looked to Vezta.

Vezta wasn’t at his side. A quick peek through the employee link found her off in the kitchens, gathering a plate of mugs along with some bread and butter. For a moment, he considered pulling her back to the meeting room. When had she even left?

“According to Vezta, we’ll find another world. One similar to our own except inhabited primarily by denizens who worship the Cloak of Shadows, the member of the Pantheon who holds dominion over the Underworld. It is Vezta’s belief that many will desire to join us.”

“They would cross over from another world to fight in our battles?”

“The Calamity is likely affecting them as well. As long as our long-term goal remains to undo that, there should be some willing to fight. Aside from that, as Zullie mentioned, I can provide magic and it seems like people from other planes of existence are heavily dependent on magic.”

“They might be less inclined to fight off dukes and inquisitors…”

“True,” Arkk agreed. “I’m not saying that everything will be perfect once we can get this ritual going, but it *shouldn’t* hurt. That said,” Arkk paused, double-checking that Vezta *wasn’t* around before speaking. “I will admit that Vezta hasn’t been there in well over a thousand years, well before the Calamity began. *She* hasn’t said this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if things changed over there as well. Maybe we’ll find people desperate for change, maybe we’ll find an idyllic world where nobody wants to rock the boat by joining us.”

Olatt’an hummed. “They may even try to fight us if we state what we’re trying to change.”

“Correct.”

“You have a plan for that?”

“Collapse the crystal archway,” Arkk said with a shrug. “Move on without them or the support of other planes.”

Olatt’an nodded his head, accepting the answer.

“Though I hope it doesn’t come to that. Vezta also mentioned the possibility of finding people who know more old magic. Or, failing that, someone who can translate the books we salvaged from the original fortress library.”

*That* was one of the main reasons Arkk wanted to get a jump on this ritual. Eight casters of any caliber shouldn’t be difficult to find. Hopefully. He wasn’t interested in magic merely for the sake of learning it anymore, it could very well mean the difference between survival and Fortress Al-Mir’s destruction—and his own along with it.

“Which brings us to our next topic,” Arkk said, turning to Ilya. “Recruitment. Is it possible?”

Ilya sat up, leaning forward. She had just gotten back from visiting Stone Hearth and Smilesville. The two closest burgs. “The inquisitors haven’t put a bounty out on us or Company Al-Mir.”

“Yet,” Rekk’ar said with a scoff.

“Yet,” Ilya agreed. “As far as I can tell, we’re in the clear. Company Al-Mir can submit recruitment notices with the garrisons. However, it probably isn’t a good idea.”

“What? Why not?” Arkk asked with a frown.

“We’re trying to maintain the fantasy that we’re not based out of the Cursed Forest, right? That was the whole reason we let the inquisitors go.”

Arkk clasped his hands together, nodding his head. “Alright. Good point. You have a suggestion?”

Ilya stood and moved to the large map hanging from the back wall of the room. It was a copy he had commissioned of the map in the Stone Hearth garrison, the entire Kingdom of Chernlock’s peninsula along with some of the rest of the continent. Ilya looked over it for a short moment before planting a finger on the western border of the Duchy, right on the Evestani border.

“Moonshine Burg,” she said. “Far away from both the Cursed Forest and from Cliff. If we set up a few of those portal chains, well hidden, we can move back and forth with relative ease while everyone else would have to travel across the entire Duchy. We go out there, get seen, and put out recruitment notices around there. Word eventually gets back to the inquisitors and they head out there instead of here.

“And…” she started, looking back to Arkk with thin-pursed lips. “While I was in the burgs earlier, the archivist mentioned that a tip had come in on the bounty you put on the slavers. It seems they’ve been active around the area.”

Arkk had a strong feeling that her choice in burgs to be seen at had a whole lot more to do with the slavers than the distance from Fortress Al-Mir. Still, it wasn’t a bad idea. He found himself nodding his head. “Alright. I don’t see why that wouldn’t work. At least until the inquisitors have us outlawed. After that… Rekk’ar, Olatt’an, I don’t suppose you’re aware of any other roaming groups of raiders who we can browbeat into joining us?”

The two orcs glanced at one another. Arkk saw the answer in their eyes before Olatt’an gave it. “There wasn’t exactly a community of raiders where we all gathered for fun and games,” he said. “In addition, our group had already subsumed most every orc we came across, including several smaller raiding parties.”

Arkk nodded then turned to Khan. “Any other gorgon groups you know of?”

The snake’s tongue darted out of his mouth. “We aren’t the mosst ssocial creaturess. Gorgon aren’t common in the firsst place. Our den iss the only one I know of.”

“I figured, thanks anyway.”

“The slavers,” Ilya said again.

“I’m not interested in recruiting slavers,” Arkk said, glancing at Olatt’an and Rekk’ar. “Maybe that’s a bit hypocritical…”

“I agree,” Ilya said, “but if we hunt them down, they’ve surely taken slaves. Judging by the ruins of Eures, a lot of them won’t have places to return to.”

Arkk wasn’t interested in recruiting former slaves either. There might be a few fighters or skilled workers among them but… most of them would surely be regular people. He couldn’t claim knowledge of how slavers operated but he guessed that anyone who could fight back would have been killed rather than captured. He was expecting a lot of children and young adults, most of who would be farmers at best. Arkk wasn’t going to make desperate people fight for Fortress Al-Mir just because *he* was desperate.

Still, he nodded to Ilya. “We’ll make the slavers a priority,” he said, reaching out to rest a hand on her arm. It was clearly important to her. And besides, maybe they would find someone who knew Yavin or Nyala and would take them off his hands. Maybe that was cruel to think but accomplishing several objectives with one move didn’t feel bad.

“Good.”

“As for recruits, we’ll have to see. I doubt many people will be happy if they join up and then the inquisitors declare Company Al-Mir outlawed. We might have to search through less reputable sources while at Moonshine Burg.”

“What have the inquisitors been up to since their departure?” Olatt’an asked.

Vezta threw open the doors, reentering the room. “We don’t know,” she said, moving around the table with her mugs of tea and bread. She had dug up fruit preserves from the storeroom as well. “Unfortunately, scrying on the inquisitors is no longer possible.”

“Not possible?” Rekk’ar barked, alarmed. “Why not?”

“Vezta was monitoring the inquisitors the entire time they were traveling back to Cliff City,” Arkk said, scowling at the glass Vezta placed in front of him. “They entered the large church there. We have never been able to scry on the interior of churches.”

“So they’re staying put?” Rekk’ar asked, calming slightly. “Good.”

“Not quite.”

“The tall inquisitor exited the church the next morning,” Vezta said. “I do not sleep and thus was able to observe the exits to the church at all times. When he emerged, he paused looked up directly at the point I was watching from, and gave a jaunty wave. After, the crystal ball went blank.”

Vezta came to a stop at Arkk’s side once again, having fully distributed her drinks and snacks among the individuals at the table. She smiled, hands clasped together at her navel. “Any attempt at scrying on one of the inquisitors results in complete failure, no matter the distance. I can scry on the street over but the crystal ball fails *before* the inquisitor enters the perspective. Presumably, I admit. I cannot say for certain given my inability to scry on them.”

“It isn’t just her,” Arkk added. “I tried and Zullie tried as well. We know where they are *not*, effectively, but even that isn’t guaranteed. I feel it would be easy to create decoy blank spots or hand whatever is blocking the scrying off to some acolyte of the abbey if they can do this.”

“There may be alternate methods of scrying that would work,” Vezta admitted. “A listening pool or soul stone. Fortress Al-Mir is not in possession of either, unfortunately.”

Rekk’ar scowled, lips curling. “The witch can’t make those?”

Arkk glanced over to Zullie, who wasn’t paying attention to the conversation in the slightest. Her eyes drifted back and forth over the text of the black book. “Zullie?”

“Huh? What?”

“Listening pool or soul stone. Can you craft those?”

“I’m a theoretical researcher, not an artificer,” she said, tone absent as she looked down at the book once again. “I can affix a spell to a magic wand. Never learned the art of artifice beyond that.”

Arkk looked back to Rekk’ar and shrugged his shoulders. “So she says.”

“So,” the orc said, “find artificers or magical artifacts as well. You sure have a list of things to get done.”

Arkk grinned, feeling a little better now that they had *something* of a plan. “The nice thing about having a lot to get done is that you’ll end up getting several things finished in the process of finishing others. Now, gather together a team for this outing to Moonshine Burg. A large team, we want to be seen. Leave those too injured and the non-fighters only, pretty much. Khan, if you can ask the gorgon for volunteers, I’m sure they would come in handy.”

Khan nodded his head. At the same time, Vezta leaned forward. “Moonshine Burg, Master?”

Arkk shot the pre-Calamity monster a *look*. “Maybe if you hadn’t run off in the middle of the meeting… Let me get you filled in.”

## 53 - Moonshine Burg


The baron of Moonshine Burg was a scrawny man with deep bags underneath his eyes. Insisting on the mononym of Doble, he invited Arkk to his manor office behind the high walls of the burg’s keep. Pouring a hospitable helping of amber liquid into a crystal glass, he took a seat in front of his paper-covered desk.

“Company Al-Mir, you say?”

“Heard of us?” Arkk said, taking up the glass and drinking a polite sip. Fine alcohol wasn’t much to his liking.

“No.”

“Ah. Well, we are a fully registered free company.” Reaching into the interior of his suit, Arkk produced a set of papers all bearing official seals. “I have papers from the Cliff Central Garrison, if you need.”

Baron Doble accepted the papers and looked through them for, frankly, longer than Arkk felt was necessary. He flipped back and forth between the papers as if checking that the information on each matched with all the others. Arkk had never really formally introduced himself to any of the burgs he had operated within in the past. Silver City came the closest and that had been the local lord rushing out to meet him and being far too grateful that *anyone* was looking into the situation in the mines to even ask about official documentation.

Here, however, Arkk intended to operate for long enough for word to spread. He felt it prudent to speak with someone in charge, just to make sure there wouldn’t be problems with a group of heavily armed individuals squatting in the local stayover for an extended period.

“You’ve only been a free company for about sixty days. Two months.”

“The company itself is new but our members are seasoned warriors and fighters.”

“Force composition?”

“Approximately twenty orcs make up the bulk of our company. We have a handful of spellcasters acting in a supportive capacity. In addition, we have four gorgon traveling with us.”

“Gorgon?” Doble asked, jolting. “You brought gorgon into my city?”

“Yes. Is that a problem?”

“A problem?” His fingers furiously massaged his forehead, sending slicked-back locks of black hair dangling forward, making him look exhausted and somewhat deranged. “Where are they now? What are they doing?”

“Resting at the Canyon’s End stayover. The journey from the central Duchy was long and exhausting.” Or it would have been if they had actually traveled all the way here by foot. It took *several* teleportation rituals but they had been able to move everyone and Arkk’s new horse out here with little trouble. The nearest teleportation circle was a fair distance out of town where they had scried a suitable hiding place in one of the northern canyons. “I assure you, they will bring no trouble to the burg.”

Doble sputtered for a moment, completely at a loss for words. Arkk doubted any other beastmen would receive such a response. Then again, gorgon weren’t normal beastmen, according to Vezta. They had come from a different plane of existence.

“And just what did you travel this far for, Mister Arkk?” the Baron asked, finally finding something to say.

“Slavers.”

The man’s panic died off somewhat as he stared at Arkk. His eyes searched back and forth, slowly coming down from his alarm. “Slavers. I heard someone placed a rather generous bounty on a group of slavers in the western Duchy.”

“That was me, actually. These slavers have personally offended me. You know anything about them?”

The Baron shook his head slowly. “I’ve received reports of villages being hit, travelers going missing, and other such indicators. I haven’t had the manpower to investigate further.”

“Really? The keep and garrison are quite sizable here. Empty buildings?”

“We have our duty,” Doble said with a frown on his face. “With the canyons to the north and mountains to the south, the plains where we sit are the most likely avenue for a hostile force to approach from Evestani. The guards must man their posts to give forewarning. Sending them searching through the wide, empty land in the hopes of coming across a few slavers that are, ultimately, a minor nuisance, is a major dereliction of duty.”

“The war ended thirty years ago,” Arkk said, matching the Baron’s frown. He did not agree with the man’s assessment of the slavers being a minor nuisance. They had destroyed an entire community of elves, for one. Likely more than that. “Are they that big of a threat?”

“Three months ago and I would have said no with a laugh. Today?” He shot a morose glance at the stacks upon stacks of papers covering his entire desk. “I don’t know. I would feel much better if the Duke would approve transfers of the Grand Guard out here.”

Arkk leaned back in his seat, wondering exactly what that meant. The war had been before his time but, from what he knew of it, the Duchy had pushed out into Evestani territory in a fairly successful campaign… until that success turned utterly sour and Evestani, in a protracted and bloody assault, shoved the Duchy and the Greater Kingdom of Chernlock back. The Duchy wasn’t as large as it once had been as a result.

But the leaders of the time had made peace.

Hadn’t they?

That, he supposed, wasn’t his problem nor something he could affect. They were twenty orcs and a few others. Not exactly the kind of force that could take on a nation. “Well, you’re in luck,” Arkk said. “We can’t reinforce your outposts but we can hopefully take off pressure from the likes of slavers and bandits. While the slavers are our priority, we’re perfectly willing to take on any commissions that might come to mind.”

Baron Doble leaned back in his chair, rubbing the thin wisps of hair on his chin. “There are a few things… We found a werecat with manacles clamped around its wrist. Looks like the chains were pulled from a wall. It might have something to do with your slavers…”

***

Arkk’s heart hurt as he looked at the overly scrawny werecat. She was mostly humanoid with grimy orange fur. One arm, as the Baron had mentioned, was *still* in a manacle. The other arm was missing entirely. It was clear that nobody had put much effort into trying to help the werecat. She didn’t even have a proper bandage around the stump of her arm.

Unfortunately, that let Arkk have a good look at the wound. The teeth marks were sharp and pointed much like the werecat’s own teeth. Arkk could immediately picture her chained to a wall. She managed to pull one of her manacles off the wall but, unable to free the other, had gnawed her own arm off.

Of course, that wasn’t even the worst part of the situation. Here, inside Moonshine Burg’s garrison, she was *still* in a cage.

As Arkk stepped closer, she *snarled* at him, lunging for the bars of her cell. She might have tried grasping him but her one intact arm just clanked as the manacle struck the bars.

“Completely feral,” the guard said, shaking his head. “Won’t let anyone close. Don’t really know what to do about it so we just toss in a slab of meat once a day and… well, ignore the beast.”

“How long has she been here?”

“Found her wandering the road outside the burg about… two weeks ago? Thereabouts.”

She escaped one cage only to be tossed into another. Could she talk? Could she lead him to the slavers? Arkk stepped closer again, crouching down to be more on her eye level. “Can you understand me?”

The werecat growled, deep and low. A threat that promised a liberal application of pointed teeth or sharp claws from her padded paw. Long, pointed ears, one of which looked like someone had taken a bite from it, flattened against her mangy orange hair.

“I’m looking for the ones who did this to you. I promise to make them pay. You can help.”

Her eyes, hazel green and slit vertically, shifted to the side for just a brief instant. Just long enough for Arkk to note the way she looked at the guard.

“The *other* ones who did this to you,” Arkk said with a frown. He received no response save for another growl, sadly. With a sigh, he stood and turned to his side. “Zullie, do you think you can do anything about her arm?”

The witch, keeping well clear of the cage, looked down. “The arm with no hand?”

Much as he hated to admit it, her brief study with the Flesh Weaving spell had turned out better than Arkk expected. Better than he could manage. She hadn’t been able to restore Katt’am’s legs but she had managed to reduce the pain by destroying nerves inside his legs, followed by a simple smoothing to make the stumps less prone to infection.

“I guess I can try,” she said. “If I don’t get my face clawed off. You have a spare arm you want grafted?”

Arkk shot her a look. She well knew that he didn’t wander around with severed arms in his pockets. Ignoring her, he turned to his other side. “Savren, can you help calm her down?”

“A simple solicitation with a simple solution. A swift spell shall supply sufficient serenity.”

“Don’t hurt her,” Arkk said, voice firm. “Or… just… be nice.”

Savren rolled his eyes, fingers curling his black beard. “Sure.”

***

“Beyond the werecat,” the Baron said, swirling around his glass of amber liquid, “there is a small community further west from here. A plateau just at the edge of the canyons. Technically within Evestani territory. A small flopkin community lives out there.”

“Flopkin?”

“Diminutive bunny-like beastmen,” the Baron said. “They stick to themselves most of the time. Once in a while, they venture out into the nearby villages and even as far out as Moonshine Burg to peddle their wares. Fresh fruit and vegetables, mostly. They’ve got the sweetest apples you’ve ever tasted.”

Arkk hummed. “I presume you aren’t commissioning me to run out and purchase a basket of apples…”

“No, no. Just, they’re well-liked among the people. I know from the reports that the slavers have been primarily targeting beastmen and demihumans. With them on their own and too far from the city to get help, I worry they may be a potential target.”

“You want us to protect them? Station guards around this… plateau?”

“I doubt that would be feasible with your numbers. Not while searching for these slavers. That said, if there is something you can do to keep them safe, I would appreciate it.”

Arkk pressed his lips together. He would have to find out more. Where was this plateau, how far away was it, what kind of defenses could they erect and how much danger were they in. That said, one idea did pop into his mind. “I might be able to come up with something…”

***

“Stupid Arkk…” Ilya grunted, digging a foot into a small crevasse on the rocky plateau’s side. “Why me?”

Tall and lithe, Ilya felt that climbing had always come naturally to her. She could reach up to places that humans couldn’t reach. Her body, lacking the pounds of muscles that orcs had, was easier to pull up. That didn’t make climbing up the sheer side of an entire mountain any easier. Ilya stretched a hand up, reaching for a small ledge. Her fingers found a firm grip on the hard stone. A small bit of security against the sheer drop down the side of the plateau.

“Vezta could have scaled this in five minutes…” she grumbled, pulling herself up to the ledge. Halfway there. The slope of the plateau dipped inward, which *should* have made it easier to scale. But she was tired, worn, exhausted. “Oh. That’s right. Because she’s a horrific inhuman entity that sends small children running and screaming.”

There had been a few incidents around Moonshine Burg. To be fair to Vezta, they weren’t all her fault. Word of armed orcs and gorgon had gotten out. Next to no one visited the stayover they had taken over as their main base of operations now. Arkk had needed to hand over a fair amount of extra gold just to keep the proprietor from kicking them out. Even then, they still weren’t happy with what was going on.

Ilya grit her teeth together, continuing her ascent. She had looked all around the base of the plateau and had been unable to find any way up. The beastmen probably lived inside the plateau, burrowing it out, which meant there had to be entrances somewhere. Oh, but Arkk couldn’t spare five minutes to scry inside and find out where. They were too busy looking for the slavers. They didn’t want to startle the skittish flopkin by invading their secret entrances or teleporting in.

Ilya hadn’t been upset about that twenty minutes ago, also of the opinion the slavers needed to be found, but that was before she had scaled half the plateau.

Now, huffing and sweating despite the chill air of winter, Ilya was cursing Arkk’s name with every step she climbed. All just to hand over a coin to hire some flopkin, thus letting them call out for Arkk if they came under attack. Who was even going to be *able* to attack a place like this?

Arms feeling like wet noodles, Ilya pulled herself up and over the final edge, crawling forward into a grove of apple trees. She sat right on the edge, back to one of the trees, and looked out over the deep canyon that stretched north. “Arkk!” she shouted despite her exhaustion, her voice carrying over the edge of the plateau. “I’m going to kill you!”

As her voice echoed off the distant canyon walls, she heard a loud crack of a snapping branch to her side.

Ilya snapped her head over, eyes meeting the wide eyes of a little white flopkin, wearing a red waistcoat and tall black hat. He was short, about half the size of a regular human, and had tall perky ears sticking up on either side of the hat. Flopkin were more beastlike than some beastmen races. Were it not for the more humanoid hands and face, he might have looked like an overgrown rabbit that someone had dressed up.

That humanoid face was expressive enough that Ilya could see the terror in his eyes. The moment she took in a breath to say something, the flopkin *bolted*, hopping off through the grove of trees.

“No, wait!” she called after the flopkin, reaching a hand out. But the beastman was gone. Long gone. Slamming her fist into the side of the tree, Ilya shouted out once again. “Arkk! This is *your* fault!”

And to think, she was going to have to climb back down once she finally hired one of the flopkin.

***

“Thank you,” Baron Doble said. “I don’t appreciate gorgon in my city but… an extra helping hand isn’t something I’m going to reject. If they cause problems…”

“They won’t,” Arkk said. “I wouldn’t travel with them if I thought they were a danger… to the general public. My enemies, on the other hand, make quite the wonderful statues.”

The Baron pursed his lips tight. Maybe it was just Arkk’s imagination but it looked like the man went a few shades paler than he already was, which was saying something. With all the paperwork on the man’s desk, Arkk had to wonder if he ever actually saw the sun. Even the windows in the room had been covered with thick cloth drapes that tinged the office in a dim red light that the white glowstones couldn’t quite fight off.

“Any other matters that might help?” Arkk asked, taking another drink of his amber alcohol. It had a smoky flavor to it that just felt out of place. Meat smoked over a fire had a similar taste. A drink that reminded him of meat just didn’t quite sit well on the back of his tongue.

The Baron fell into silence for a long moment, thinking. He eventually sat forward, nodding his head. “To my great dismay, Moonshine Burg has always had a plague of bandits and highwaymen in its vicinity. Which is likely why these slavers thought it would be good to set up here.”

“Personnel issues stopped you from dealing with all that as well?”

“Indeed. It has forced us to take some unpleasant actions… Ah, but the history of Moonshine Burg is hardly your concern,” he said with a shake of his head. “One group of highwaymen, in particular, has been distressingly aggressive in the last month. They went from merely robbing the occasional passing merchants to outright halting trade, killing practically every traveler that passes through their territory, and otherwise making trouble. I had been trying to figure out the best way to deal with them but if you can spare some time…”

“Depends, I suppose. Are they related to the slavers?”

“I do not believe so, though I cannot say for certain. Perhaps you could ask them?”

“I’ll need more details before I commit to anything.”

“I am prepared to pay quite the generous bounty.”

For a moment, Arkk was prepared to dismiss that as a factor entirely. With Fortress Al-Mir sitting atop a gold mine, he didn’t exactly need funds. However, he intended to recruit. And the ritual room would have to be reconstructed, incurring a cost. There was also the fact that, right now, back home, he was having his lesser servants expand aggressively throughout the entirety of the Cursed Forest.

Digging out new space didn’t cost gold and he didn’t have anything to fill those empty spaces with just yet, but he might one day. Right now, he just wanted as much of the land under his control as possible. Preferably with easily blocked or collapsed passages, decoy tunnels, and a full maze-like labyrinth that would be nearly impossible for anyone to traverse without using magical means.

It was quite the project. With all three of those factors and the fact that he truly had no idea how long that gold mine would last, he wasn’t sure that it was wise to keep turning down the rewards for mercenary work.

Besides that, it was just what a proper mercenary company would do.

“Tell me more,” Arkk said, leaning forward.

## 54 - Visibility


“Master,” Vezta said, sliding her body to one side to dodge the oncoming axe strike of a random brigand. She didn’t need to retaliate. One of the orcs planted a pike in his back. “I don’t mean to question your decisions,” she continued as if nothing had happened, “but is this the wisest usage of our time?”

“That depends,” Arkk said, arms clasped behind his back. Zharja snaked forward, coiling up around one of their attackers. Restrained in her coils, arms pinned at his side, he couldn’t do anything about the increase in pressure as the gorgon crushed him to death. Arkk turned away with a grimace as he focused on the rest of the battlefield. “Can you think of anything better to do at the moment than take out a band of highwaymen?

“I would like to keep Moonshine Burg happy while we’re hanging around,” Arkk continued, watching as an orc took a glaive to her armored shoulder, ignored the weapon entirely, and used a mace to cave in her attacker’s face. “Besides that, criminals know criminals… right? Someone should be able to point us in the direction of our actual target here.”

Vezta peered around, frowning at the carnage. “If anyone survives.”

That was a point. Arkk should probably have mentioned something earlier about taking some prisoners. This was the first time that the orcs had been able to go all-out, heedless of any consequences, since joining Fortress Al-Mir. It shouldn’t have been a surprise that they were taking to the task with gusto, but…

A bellowed cry of battle, echoed by several of the orcs, drew his attention to Dakka. The shortest orc was in the thick of the melee. Her spiked shield perforated one poor man before she dropped it entirely, grabbing her axe with both hands to slam the edge down over another brigand’s skull. With her imposing black armor, he couldn’t see her face. Arkk wasn’t sure that this was the kind of fun that he should be encouraging. That said, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving group.

He had seen more than enough evidence of pillaging and looting inside this cave, here out in the canyon beyond Appletop Village. Combined with the Baron of Moonshine Burg’s statement that they had been more violent than could be allowed as of late, Arkk didn’t have too much sympathy for the highwaymen.

Arkk’s eyes swept over a set of shattered statues, noting the eerie red glow that his gaze cast.

This little outing was advantageous for several reasons. Not the least of which was that he had learned a little more about how gorgons worked. He could and should have just asked Zharja. Despite Savren decrying her as disobedient, Arkk found her to be quite friendly. At least in comparison to the rest of the gorgon, who were all rather closed-off.

Gorgon petrification was not a widespread effect nor could it be done in rapid succession. It was magic, much like any other spell, that required focus, concentration, and effort. The four gorgon who had come with him on this little team-building exercise had each been able to turn one brigand to stone. After that, they began fighting with their other abilities—their coils and, in one particularly gruesome case, their acidic venom—before they resumed petrifying anyone else.

Good to know for the future.

“Should we not be recruiting at the moment?” Vezta asked, lightly pressing a finger against one intact statue, sending it to the ground where it broke into pieces. “We still need spellcasters for the ritual.”

Perhaps some of these highwaymen could have been convinced to join him as the orcs had but…

Arkk didn’t want to staff Company Al-Mir *entirely* with criminals and outlaws. They had enough as it was. He needed recruits but preferably other mercenaries, former soldiers, or other less objectionable sorts.

“True.” Arkk wasn’t exactly sure how to recruit for something like that. Assuming Purifier Agnete was willing to help—something he still needed to discuss with her—they had their high-level spellcasters all set. That meant anyone would do as long as they could cast spells. “Haven’t seen anyone here cast spells” Arkk deflected.

“You haven’t posted recruitment notices in the Burg yet either.”

“No. But this might help with that. We’re getting the orcs some exercise. Letting the orcs and gorgon get used to each other. Taking out some murderers and thieves. Increasing the renown of Company Al-Mir.” That last one was most important for recruitment. He felt people would be much more willing to join up despite potential complications with inquisitors if he showed that Company Al-Mir could get things done. “I’m still expecting some edict from the inquisitors or the church decrying us. I want to make sure we’re not going to get immediately lynched if that happens.

While Zullie and Savren had been trying to work with the werecat and Ilya had been at Appletop Village, Arkk and Vezta had taken several very *visible* walks through Moonshine Burg. They moved through the streets, ate at taverns, visited the garrison, and tried their best to make sure *everyone* saw him and Vezta. He had even asked Vezta to not wear her human legs. The mobile mass of tendrils were far more notable—and hopefully the subject of gossip—than a violet-hued human.

With luck, word would get back to the inquisitors and they would waste time out here looking for them instead of going anywhere near Langleey and Fortress Al-Mir.

In a few weeks, they could make an appearance on the opposite side of Mystakeen. Maybe pop over to one of the principalities and get some rumors going about them being out there. With the inquisitors running ragged across the entire kingdom, that should buy plenty of breathing room.

“*Electro Deus*,” Arkk said. Lightning flung one brigand across the cave after he got a little too close. Arkk wasn’t too worried about his safety. Vezta, with eyes everywhere, could spot just about any threat coming their way. Still, a little casual show of force to remind everyone why he was in charge couldn’t hurt.

This situation wasn’t at all comparable to previous fights they had been in. Taken by surprise in the dead of night, the brigands hadn’t been able to grab more than their weapons. Few had managed to grab any armor. Most were human, though there were a few orcs and one beastman—a dog-like kobold. There weren’t even that many of them. Less than fifty.

Fifty startled and unprepared ruffians weren’t at all a match for twenty war-ready orcs with gorgon backup. Not to mention him and Vezta.

Judging by the noise in the cavern, the battle was wrapping up too. There were far fewer shouts and screams. The sound of metal clashing against metal died down. Quickly checking over the health of all his minions in the area, Arkk noted a few moderate injuries but nothing that indicated immediate danger. Certainly, nothing that would require one of the gorgon to petrify someone. He could practice the Flesh Weaving spell a bit more and they would be done.

“I’m also not sure about both of us leaving Fortress Al-Mir for extended periods,” Vezta said. “Some of your recent hires have left questionable impressions.”

Arkk quickly scanned through the entire fortress, mentally observing each and every room. With the majority of orcs with him, it was practically deserted. John and Hale were back at Langleey, at least for now. The four gorgon who had not accompanied him were enjoying themselves around their heated rocks.

Olatt’an and Larry were discussing something just outside the cafeteria. Two orcs that Arkk had not brought with him were eating.

Purifier Agnete was inside the smithy. *Inside* the forge, seated cross-legged on the glowing red coals with her head halfway up the flue. Arkk… wasn’t quite sure what to think about that. She wasn’t getting into trouble, which was good, but… Was that how she acted with the inquisitors? Or was she experimenting with a newfound freedom that she had lacked before?

Prior to departing on this excursion to track down the slavers, Vezta had given him a brief description of the Burning Forge. Arkk had relayed the lesson to Agnete, feeling it best if the ‘horror from beyond the stars’ was kept separate from her for the moment.

The Burning Forge was some kind of goddess of fire, creativity, manufacturing, and automation that took the guise of a woman made of molten slag, held together by binding chains. In the old days, pre-Calamity, practically every smith had small shrines to the Burning Forge alongside their actual forge. Allegedly, maladies, mishaps, and poor products awaited those who failed to pay proper tribute to the deity while those who did earn her favor were capable of near-inhuman levels of quality in their products.

Vezta had been less clear on what an avatar was, aside from one chosen by a member of the Pantheon. They were supposedly rare enough that Vezta had never met one, even though both Zullie and Agnete said that there was more than one purifier with similar capabilities within the ranks of the inquisitors.

Maybe, by sitting inside the forge, Agnete was trying to get closer to her patron goddess. Or maybe she just liked the heat.

Shaking his head, Arkk focused back on his immediate surroundings. “No problems at the fortress right now,” he said. “If an emergency arises, we can and will return as fast as possible. Until then, being seen out here is probably keeping the fortress safer.”

“Very well,” Vezta said, dipping her head in a nod. “We…” she started but trailed off.

Dakka strode up to them, hauling some human over her spiked shoulder. Arkk stood a little straighter, smiling. Leave it to his field commander to understand that information gathering needed live brigands.

It did not look like a particularly comfortable ride though. The way she threw him to the ground at Arkk’s feet didn’t look particularly comfortable either. The man, wearing a casual brown tunic marred with small cuts and more than a little blood, moaned and groaned as he tried to back away. Dakka put a stop to that with a light kick to the side of his head, shattering one lens of his round glasses.

“What’s this?” Arkk asked, looking up from the man.

“A coward. Wouldn’t fight with the others. I thought about bashing his head in but wondered if you were interested in prisoners.”

Arkk hummed, scratching his chin. A show. Something to put the brigand on edge. “I suppose we can take him into town,” Arkk said, looking at Dakka. “They wanted proof that we wiped out the highwaymen anyway. He should suffice—”

“Wait!”

Looking down at the man-made him cower as the red light from Arkk’s gaze washed over him. “Hmm?”

“I’m… I’m not one of these people! They captured me!”

“Reports in town was that this group of brigands didn’t take prisoners. They attacked wealthy-looking travelers and killed any who didn’t escape.”

“They took me!” he *pleaded*. “Please, you have to help—”

“He had a sword on him when I found him,” Dakka said. “Just didn’t use it. No bindings on his wrists either. Was in a pretty fancy tent filled with kegs of ale that I *intend* to return to.”

Arkk looked back down at their captive, who was shooting a particularly nasty look at Dakka now. As soon as he realized Arkk was looking, a mask of innocence slid into place.

“I… escaped during the chaos?”

Arkk gave a slow shake of his head. “We’ll haul him back to the burg. They can figure out whether he is a missing traveler or one of the—”

“You can’t do that! They’ll kill me.”

“We’ll kill you,” Dakka said with no mercy. “We *should*. I’d rather carry one of those kegs on my shoulder than *this*.”

“I have a daughter!” he cried. “A little girl… she…” He trailed off, looking to Arkk. Squinting through his glasses like he couldn’t quite see him properly. That wouldn’t have been much of a surprise given the shattered lens but the moment he looked over the top of the rim, his squinting stopped. He tried to stand only for Dakka to pin him back down with her heel on his shoulder. “I mean, a lovely young woman. Surely you’re interested in women? You wouldn’t kill off your own father-in-law.”

“I might if you were that father-in-law,” Arkk said with a shake of his head. “We’ll take him to the burg. Tie him—”

“I know where the treasure is.”

“Tie him up.”

“We have a dozen other hideouts where we store things until we can get rid of them. Valuable things. Treasure, gold, gemstones, and other things that are useless out here in the wilds!”

“Probably gag him too,” Arkk said, turning away.

“I… lots of ale,” he said, looking to Dakka. “The finest wines and… uh… I know where other hideouts are! You are mercenaries, right? Interested in finishing off some others? We’re just small fry compared to them. I *know* the price on our heads isn’t worth the paper it is written on but some of the other groups around here…”

Arkk paused and slowly looked back.

The brigand stiffened but donned a shaky smile. “Interested?”

“Boss,” Dakka said. “He’s lying. *Obviously*.”

Arkk held up a hand, stalling further commentary from Dakka. He wouldn’t claim to know exactly what he was doing but that was enough threatening him for now. Time for the carrot… assuming he knew anything. “We’re in the region looking for slavers that might have moved in nearby. Know anything about them?”

“Oh definitely,” the man said with a firm nod of his head. “Bad for business, they are. Drawing all kinds of heat down on our heads. Like you.”

“Know where they are based?”

“I… yes. Of course.”

“*Boss*…”

“Let me rephrase the question,” Arkk said. “There are three possible outcomes of our situation. Which choice do you want? First option: We take you to the burg and hand you over to the garrison. They probably hang you. Maybe they just throw you in an oubliette and forget about you.”

“Not that one, please.”

“Alright, second choice: You make yourself useful to us; you get to keep living and maybe even have a relative degree of freedom. In exchange, you tell us everything you know. Other hideouts, other groups of brigands, and *especially* this group of slavers.”

The man nodded twice but couldn’t stop himself from asking, “What’s the third choice? Not kill me now, I hope.”

“Oh no, that isn’t a choice anymore. The third choice is the same as the second except that we find out you’re lying to us. At that point, you’ll likely regret ever being born.” Arkk smiled, watching as the red light washing over the man intensified. “I have a warlock in my employ who specializes in mind magic and can put you into your own worst nightmare. Gorgon can trap you as a stone statue for a year, letting you slowly go insane as you can still think but are locked into place. And, of course, Vezta.” Arkk motioned behind him.

Vezta, hands clasped over her navel, gave a demure nod of her head.

“Wh… What—”

“You don’t want to know,” Arkk said.

In truth, if he didn’t know anything, they would probably just hand him over to the burg. Arkk didn’t have the patience or desire to torture someone for any length of time. That said, Arkk was *not* above making threats.

“So, what will it be?”

“I… uh… well. Number two still sounds the best.”

“Of course.”

“But maybe we should lower the expectations you want from me. I—”

“Do you know where the slavers are or not?”

The man licked a bit of blood off his lips before smiling up at Arkk. “I know where to go to find them?”

Arkk stared for a long, *long* minute, not moving even as the man shifted under his gaze. Was he telling the truth? Did it matter if he wasn’t?

Forcing a smile, Arkk held out a hand. “Welcome aboard.”

The hesitance with which the man accepted the handshake did not fill Arkk with confidence. Still, he felt the minion bond form between them. Weak but there. At the very least, he wasn’t about to be stabbed in the back.

“Any other survivors?” Arkk called out through the cavern, not helping the man to his feet even though he was in a prime position to do so. When no one answered him, Arkk shrugged. “The burg wanted heads. Gather the bodies on that side of the cavern and we’ll have our new friend here find the most recognizable and notorious of the bunch. After that, gather up all their ill-gotten gains in the middle of the cavern!”

That got a few cheers from the orcs. *Looting, yay*! A lot of it was going to be useless to them. The gold coins Arkk paid out were probably worth more than anything here. Still, as had been pointed out to him, it was about the *feel* of the experience. He would let them take what they wanted. Everything else would go to the garrison. Maybe it would make its way back into the hands of the rightful owners. Maybe it would end up in some captain’s pockets. At that point, it wouldn’t be his problem anymore.

“What’s your name?”

“What?”

“Name. I presume you have one.”

“Uh… Right. My name is…” He trailed off, looking around the room. “Cave.”

“Right,” Arkk said, tone utterly flat. “I assume Dead Body is your last name? Or maybe Cave Raider? Cave Sword?”

“Yes, actually. Cave Sword. My mother always called me her little sharpened blade. How did you know?”

“It isn’t too late to throw you to the garrison, you know.”

“Alright, alright,” he said, holding up his hands. “My name is Edvin. No family name.”

Arkk doubted it. He didn’t bother pressing the matter. As long as this guy lead them to the slavers, he could call himself King Abe Lafoar, Ruler of the Kingdom of Chernlock for all Arkk cared.

“Well, Edvin, best get to identifying your former comrades.”

“Ah. The most notorious, you said? You know, I always found beheading to be quite a barbarous practice,” Edvin said, not hiding his grimace as he glanced over to where the orcs were hauling the bodies.

Arkk didn’t necessarily disagree. Maybe it was a bit tasteless to have this man dig through the corpses. Still… “Not my rules. The garrison wants heads, we get them heads.”

“Exactly why I left society in the first place,” Edvin said, snapping his fingers.

“And joined a murderous band of highwaymen instead?”

“Murderous? Hardly. We only killed in self-defense. Anything else is slander, I say. Slander.”

Dakka shot Arkk a doubtful look. She raised an eyebrow before turning and walking off. “I’m going to need those kegs of ale before the night is out, I can tell already.”

Arkk let out a sigh, wondering if there was enough ale for him as well. “Just… get to it,” Arkk said, waving off to the side of the cavern.

“Sure thing, *boss*,” Edvin said, making sure to respectfully emphasize the word. “Mind if I loot a few of the bodies while I’m at it? Waste-not want-not, that is what my mother always said.”

“I do mind, actually. Besides, I’m sure the orcs have already done so.”

Edvin glanced off to the side, watching  Orjja kneel and start rummaging through one body’s pockets. His shoulders slumped. “Right. Of course. Guess they aren’t my kills anyway. Don’t worry, I can show you that my presence has worth. Don’t you worry. Yep. Don’t worry…” he mumbled, more to himself as he started off toward the area the orcs were dragging bodies.

Arkk watched him go for just a moment before glancing at Vezta. “Mind keeping an eye on him?”

Vezta bowed at her waist but glanced up with a *look* on her face. “Some of your recent hires…” she said with a shake of her head as she started after Edvin.

“Don’t remind me.”

## 55 - Bandit Lord


Arkk hunkered down, peering through the twilight-draped brush.

A small, lonely hill stood amid the dusty plains. Several buildings sat on top. Large wooden warehouse-style homes, built in a ring around a central plaza. Though he only knew that from scrying. His position at the moment didn’t let him see much more than the spiked tops of wooden fences encircling the top of the hill. All down the hill’s sides, narrow wooden rods jutted out of the mound. Their tips had been shaved to points as well. They were placed haphazardly and irregularly, hindering any attempts to navigate up the sides of the hill.

If he hadn’t known better, he might have thought it was nothing more than a particularly protective village.

“That right there is a little place we call Porcupine Hill.”

“Creatively named,” Arkk said.

“Bandits and highwaymen aren’t known for their poets and scholars,” Edvin said with a shrug. “Especially not *these* bandits. They’re the true power out here in the western Duchy. Even the Duke’s men steer clear of here.”

“And they’re associated with the slavers?”

“Not unless something has changed lately. Their leader can’t stand slavers. Used to be one, I gather.”

“A slaver?”

“A slave.”

“Ah.” Arkk’s eyes scanned over the unwelcoming hill for a long minute before he turned to Edvin. “They know where the slavers are?”

“I sure hope so! I’d rather not find out what you plan to do with me if I’ve inadvertently lied.”

As long as Edvin made an earnest effort, Arkk doubted he would have cause to do anything drastic. Not that he told Edvin that. In the three days since Arkk and the orcs had raided Edvin’s group, the man had done little to endear himself to Arkk. Not for a lack of trying either. In fact, that was part of the problem.

Edvin tried a little *too* much. Nearly every word the man said was some poorly disguised attempt at ingratiating himself with either Arkk or one of Arkk’s employees. His words didn’t elicit much of a reaction. Except for the few words he had for Ilya, which had earned him that black and blue bruise around his eye. It would have been pitiful if Arkk hadn’t thought he was doing it on purpose.

What was more, it was like the man couldn’t tell the truth if his life depended on it. Which, unless he had seen through Arkk’s less-than-lethal threats, it did. Even if he had seen through those threats, Arkk was still more than willing to hand him over to the local garrison.

All that made Arkk less than thrilled about this whole operation. He had half a mind to sit around and hope that the slavers hit Appletop Village. The only reason he wasn’t doing that was that doing so would likely end up with a large number of dead flopkins before he could intervene. Sometimes, being proactive about a problem was necessary even when that proactivity put him in an unpleasant situation.

“So, we’re just going to walk in through the front door?”

“The hill was designed to make other paths unpalatable.”

“Alright,” Arkk said, standing. He looked back to Dakka and Ilya, both of whom were giving Arkk the flattest looks they could. “Stick together—”

“Woah, hold on. Best to leave the others behind,” Edvin said, further increasing Arkk’s distrust in the man. “They see an army marching up the hill and they’re going to start raining arrows on us before we get close enough to explain what we want. Unless you want a war…”

“Bet the garrisons would pay us for taking this place out too,” Dakka said with a casual shrug.

“Yes,” Edvin said, “but what of the slavers? You might accidentally kill the one who knows about them.”

“This is obviously a trap,” Ilya said, hand resting on her dagger.

“You question my honor, elf?”

“Yes.”

“Oh… Well… Mother always said not to bite the hand that feeds you. Right now, that’s you guys. You can trust that at least.”

Arkk sighed, closing his eyes and shaking his head. “He is probably not wrong, unfortunately. If we head up there as a large group, they’re going to attack before we can get into striking *or* talking distance.”

“You can’t be serious,” Ilya said.

“It makes sense, doesn’t it?”

Ilya just pressed her lips together.

“Dakka,” Arkk said, “you stay here. Stay ready though.” Pulling the crystal ball from his satchel, Arkk tossed it over to Vezta. “If anything happens, I’m sure you can guess what to do.”

Vezta caught the glass ball with a single hand. She looked down at the ball before her golden eyes flicked over to Arkk. “You would not prefer my presence at your side?”

“No offense,” Edvin said before Arkk could speak, “but you’d probably start a war on your own.”

Aside from one of the eyes on Vezta’s shoulder shifting, she gave no indication that she had even heard Edvin speak. Her attention was entirely on Arkk.

“It was definitely a consideration. Unfortunately, you’re the only one who knows how to make the circles.”

“We should have brought Zullie along.”

At the mention of his researcher, Arkk took a quick glimpse into Fortress Al-Mir. Savren and Zullie were both back there for the time being, standing inside the temple-ritual room, seemingly arguing about something. The former kept gesturing toward one of the cardinal spots while Zullie had her arms crossed over her chest, looking unimpressed. It likely related to the changes Zullie suggested needed to be made.

Hoping *that* wasn’t going to become a major problem before he returned, Arkk shook his head. “Too late now. Don’t worry. I can hold my own long enough.” Turning, Arkk started, “Ilya—”

“You aren’t going in there *alone*.”

“Of course he isn’t,” Edvin said, straightening his back.

“No, you’re coming with me,” Arkk said. “I need someone watching Edvin.”

The highwayman deflated somewhat but Arkk’s response mollified Ilya. She gave a curt nod of her head before fixing her silver eyes on Edvin. “One wrong move…” she said, fingers curling tighter around her dagger.

Edvin just held up his hands, backing away slowly. “Clingy, isn’t she?” he mumbled.

Arkk wasn’t sure if he was talking to himself or if he meant for Arkk to hear. Either way, Arkk didn’t bother responding. He looked over the group and, after a moment’s thought, nodded his head. “Zharja, you come as well.”

One of the four gorgon present slithered forward, nodding her head as she moved. In the closing darkness, her dark scales made her almost invisible.

While this whole trip had been instigated for the benefit of the inquisitors, Arkk was accomplishing several minor tasks with it. And, with the defeat of the slavers, a major task as well. Of the smaller issues, Arkk was most pleased with the gorgon. They weren’t exactly integrating with the orcs but Arkk wasn’t expecting them to. He just wanted to make sure that they got used to being near one another, to avoid any incidents and, hopefully, to help alleviate some of Rekk’ar’s concerns.

Rekk’ar wasn’t present but if some of the orcs here spoke about their experiences, that would help.

So far, the gorgon being around had been quite a success. They helped out with raiding Edvin’s hideout and Arkk had heard no complaints from any party.

Except for Edvin, of course, who was currently eying Zharja with undisguised wariness. “Are you *sure* that is a good idea? I’ve heard *things* about gorgon and their eyes.”

“Then you sshouldn’t sstare sso much,” Zharja said with an intimidating hiss. “Or my eyess might be the lasst thing you ssee.”

“Alright, alright,” Arkk said. “Save your energy for a fight, if there is one.”

“There might be once they see *that*,” Edvin said, shuddering as he turned his gaze away. “Hope I’m enough to calm them down.”

“They know you?”

“Everyone out here pays tribute to Porcupine Hill. They know me. We go way back. I was here just last—”

“Save the stories,” Arkk said. “We’re going.”

***

Arkk wasn’t as worried as he thought he should be. A few months ago and he would never have imagined himself willingly walking into a bandit encampment. A few months ago and he had hardly left his village. Now, he had Ilya at one side, a gorgon at his other, and he had some kind of ancient, pre-Calamity monster ready to teleport in with a horde of orcs if things looked like they were going south.

What a strange turn his life had taken. How long had it been since he found the fortress? He stumbled across it about a month before harvest. So shy of four months since then? Practically overnight he had gone from a nobody peasant to a wealthy commander of a fairly competent mercenary force.

Idly, Arkk rubbed at the back of his neck, wondering if Hawkwood would recognize him as the peasant he was or if he had changed enough from then to appear as a peer.

“Now, I know you mercenary types like to beat your heads into brick walls until the walls give way but this situation is going to take a delicate touch. I’m not claiming that we’re all bloodthirsty barbarians but we *are* familiar with violence. If you don’t want to die, follow my lead. Let me do most of the talking, hey?”

Arkk shared a look with Ilya.

They were being led into a trap. The minion bond formed by Fortress Al-Mir might keep his employees from stabbing him in the back but it didn’t overwrite their free will. Edvin could plot and plan against Arkk all he wanted. He just wouldn’t be able to take the final action without putting forth a bit of effort into breaking that bond.

According to Vezta. It wasn’t something Arkk had experienced. Yet.

Getting other people to do the work for him? Letting this group of bandits surround them and take action on their own?

That seemed entirely possible.

“Sure,” Arkk said, still not that worried. Between his lightning bolts, Ilya’s bow, and Zharja’s abilities as a gorgon, he was confident in holding off an ambush long enough for Vezta to arrive.

Taking a glimpse of Vezta, he found her drawing out several ritual circles in the ground. They were incomplete—she didn’t know exactly where the destination would be—but they were all but ready to send the whole army of orcs in at once.

“That’s close enough!”

Arkk stopped, as did the rest of his group, at the voice from the wall. He couldn’t quite make out the figure poking his head over the top of the spiked palisade in the darkness but he could see their silhouette in the light from the full moon. Were it not for the moon, he doubted he would have been able to see anyone at all.

Movement drew his eyes along the wall. More silhouettes stood atop. These were archers, readying bows and arrows.

That did give Arkk some pause. He took a step closer to Zharja and pulled Ilya with him. He had long since memorized Zullie’s spell for stopping projectiles and had spent some time practicing it, making sure he could speak both quickly and without his tongue tying into a not. He still wasn’t sure that he would be able to get the entire incantation out before an arrow crossed the short distance between them but having it on the tip of his tongue was better than nothing.

“Well, Edvin? You wanted us to leave the talking to you.”

“Uh… right.” The man cleared his throat. “Oh great wall captain of Porcupine Hill, I have come—”

“Oh Light,” someone atop the wall groaned, loud enough to be distinctly audible to everyone. “It’s Edvin.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow. “That’s actually your name?”

Edvin glanced back just long enough to shoot Arkk a withering look before returning his attention to the wall. “Yes, it is I! I have returned with a solution to—”

“You were told what would happen if you came back,” someone else shouted down.

“Oh come now, I apologized for the tomb business.”

“He led my brother to his death in the marshes!”

“That was an accident no one could have predicted and I resent—”

“Throw him to the wurms!” one shouted, receiving a few echoing cheers from others on the wall.

Edvin flinched, taking a step back. He shifted like he was going to look at Arkk again but held himself before he moved, straightening his shoulders.

“Thought these were your friends,” Ilya hissed.

Arkk nodded his agreement. His suspicions of this being a trap were slowly yet steadily diminishing. That didn’t necessarily mean that these bandits *wouldn’t* attack them. It just meant that they would attack him *and* Edvin.

“Did I say friends?” He shook his head. “We just need to talk to their leader, they won’t do anything without…”

Torchlight on the wall made Edvin trail off. Two new faces appeared over the top of the palisade wall. One, an older man carrying the torch. The other was a younger woman with darker skin and black tattoos on her face and bare arms, giving her the appearance of a striped animal. She glared down with the torchlight flickering in her eyes, arms crossed over her chest.

“Edvin…”

“Katja! It’s so good—”

“Throw him to the wurms.”

“Kat! No, Kat! We’re here to help!”

“Help?” The woman tilted her head upward, sneering down at Edvin. “Every word you speak brings death and disaster.”

“That’s not true at all.”

“You have violated your exile. There is one punishment.”

“I’m not here with schemes or tall tales or maps pointing toward buried treasure,” Edvin said, speaking as fast as he could. “I’m here with *solutions*. I *know* those newcomers haven’t been playing by your rules and my fine companions here want their heads on a pike!”

For the first time since approaching the wall, Arkk felt attention shift toward him. Deciding that Edvin was more of a liability at this point than an asset, Arkk stepped forward.

“I’m Arkk, leader of Company Al-Mir. We have a personal interest in annihilating this group of slavers. Edvin claimed you would be able to point us in their direction.”

Katja’s eyes shifted in the torchlight, looking back to Edvin. “You bring mercenaries to our doorstep?”

“I *told* you to leave the talking to me,” Edvin hissed.

“That wasn’t getting us anywhere,” Arkk whispered back.

Hanging his head, Edvin sighed before looking back up to the wall. “Didn’t have much choice. They kind of utterly destroyed Marv’s group.”

“Marv is gone?”

“Delivered his head to Moonshine Burg’s garrison just yesterday.”

“Other survivors?”

“You’re looking at him!”

Katja’s face lit up. It was hard to tell in the poor light of the torch but Arkk thought she looked pleased. That lasted but a moment before she scowled down at Edvin once more. “You should have died with your brothers.”

“Brothers is a *bit* more familial than—”

“Shut up,” Katja hissed before turning back to Arkk. “You, mercenary, have made a poor decision—several, likely, if you have been following Edvin’s advice.”

“So it seems,” Arkk said, “though that doesn’t change our reason for being here. Tell us where the slavers are.”

The woman stared for a long moment before dropping her arms to her sides. Arkk tensed. If the call to attack went out, it would come from her. However, she didn’t give a signal to the others on the wall. Clasping her hands together behind her back, she started pacing along the wall, speaking as she moved.

“Demanding for your position. Do you not see who holds the power here? Even with a gorgon at your side, you cannot survive all of us.”

Arkk shrugged. Vezta had finalized the teleportation circles. Each orc had its own, meaning they would all teleport in at the same time. No delay as they passed through one by one. If Arkk were to guess, he would assume that Vezta aimed the teleportation circles directly behind each of the bandits.

He had half a mind to signal Vezta right now. A simple hand movement behind his back would have her here in an instant. The only thing staying his hand was how little he wanted to advertise Al-Mir’s ability to utilize those circles. Both Zullie and Vezta said that such teleportation could be warded against. The Duke’s manor had magical protections that would likely work against him and the inquisitors had already taken to blocking his scrying. He didn’t want more magical defenses springing up.

This was another of the main reasons why only Edvin had survived their raid on the raiders. Anyone who saw the teleportation circles used in such offensive mannerisms would have to die or join him.

He wasn’t necessarily opposed to wiping out another contingent of bandits here but it was a much larger place with the possibility of secret escape routes and alternative means of getting away. Unless he was sure, he would rather *not* start something.

So he just smiled, nodded his head, and let the striped bandit leader continue, giving her a moment of power, even if it was illusory.

“On the other hand, it is true. These newcomers have become a thorn in my side. We were preparing our own… response to the situation. A little tit-for-tat. Though with Marv gone…” She trailed off, turning from her pacing to face Arkk once again. “Yes. If you’re willing to soften them up for us, who I am I refuse that?”

“Then you’ll point us in the right direction?”

“Horrik!” Katja barked, turning her head to the older man at her side. “Fetch Lexa. She can lead them.”

“Aye.”

Nodding, Katja turned to Arkk, glanced at Edvin, and then back to Arkk. “A little free advice: Drop him down the deepest hole you can find at the first available opportunity. You can thank me later.”

“Noted,” Arkk said, smiling.

They had a guide of some sort. One who could lead them to the slavers. He could see the anticipation on Ilya’s face without even turning his head.

Soon.

## 56 - Turnabout


Tracking down the slavers was taking longer than Arkk had hoped for. The land outside Moonshine Burg was vast and empty. Old outposts dotted the plains, most long abandoned, relics of the old war.

Arkk stared down at Lexa, a gremlin who barely stood tall enough to reach his waist, with a frown on his face. On *loan* from the leader of the bandits, she wasn’t a proper employee. That had Arkk a little on edge in her presence. The way she looked at him, large eyes roaming over his shoulders and arms, had him a little *more* on edge. He didn’t get the feeling that she was likely to stab him in the back from the way she stared, more like… she was interested in him.

“So these things are so handy. Is it true they can see anywhere?” she asked, peering into a blank crystal ball. “*Anywhere*?”

“Yes,” Arkk lied. He didn’t want the weakness of churches or whatever the inquisitors had done to themselves to become widely spread information.

“Like… inside the quarters of your boss?” Lexa grinned, sharp teeth on display as she ran a hand through her spiked mass of bright red hair. “How do I get me one of these?”

“I doubt Katja would appreciate that.”

“Nonsense. She invites me in at least once a fortnight.”

Arkk shook his head. “Just find the slavers. That’s what you’re here for. Nothing else.”

“Yeah, yeah. I got it. The guy Kat captured wasn’t too specific about *which* of the old outposts they’re squatting in. When she told me to guide you around, I thought we’d be *walking* to check each one. Not kicking back and relaxing with a garrison-provided map of their old outposts and this sweet ball.”

“This is the second time you’ve mentioned capturing one of the slavers,” Arkk said, sharing a pitying look with Ilya. The elf was going to be the one making sure Lexa stayed on task, backed up by Dakka and two other orcs. He did not envy them. “Why don’t *we* try interrogating him?”

“Oh sure!” she said with a dark grin. “It’s been a few weeks but I’m sure a competent necromancer would be able to ask a few questions. Might be tough getting his remains back from the wurms though.”

Arkk shook his head slowly. “Never mind. Is there anything else you need besides the map and crystal ball?”

Her grin turned sly as her eyes roamed up and down Arkk. “Wouldn’t mind you sticking a little close by. Maybe a few more orc guards too,” she said, casting a lecherous glance around the small room of the tent they had set up a distance outside Moonshine Burg.

Neither she nor Edvin were allowed inside the city proper. Only Edvin was wanted by the garrison, Arkk had checked, but he didn’t want to risk being associated with her either.

Arkk stared a moment before flicking his eyes up to Ilya, meeting an utterly ferocious glare. He had known her long enough that he could figure out some of what she was thinking. Right now, it was something along the lines of ‘Please don’t leave me alone with this gremlin. I’d rather have Edvin here! Or even the Duke! Arkk! Please! Don’t go!’. With a silent apology, Arkk turned and stepped out of the tent without another word.

Pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose, Arkk shook his head. It would be fine. Probably. Dakka was there to make sure no one got hurt. The fact that the orc had been trying to suppress chuckles didn’t mean that she wouldn’t do her job.

With that operation underway and no immediate tasks from the local baron to see to, Arkk figured it was high time to attend to one thing he had been neglecting thus far.

“Worried, Master?”

Arkk glanced up to find Vezta approaching, steps demure as she maneuvered around a pair of gorgon who were enjoying the heat of the sun despite the cold air. All they needed was a small wall around them to keep the direct breeze off their scales.

Vezta came to a stop in front of him, the heels of her boots clicking against the floor. She cocked her head to one side, looking at him before deliberately flicking her eyes over his shoulder at the closed tent flaps.

“I don’t want to hear a word about recent hires,” Arkk said, moving away from the tent so that the occupants wouldn’t hear. “I didn’t even hire the gremlin.”

“I didn’t say anything,” Vezta said, a thin smile spreading across her face.

“But… speaking of new hires… I want you to meet Agnete properly.”

The smile on Vezta’s face froze in place. “I am not sure I am enthused with that idea any more than I am enthused with her presence at Fortress Al-Mir.” She looked down at her arm. Or the spot where her arm *should* have been. It did look better than it had immediately after the inquisitors injured her but still wasn’t back to normal. “The magic she wields is given by a god. The damage it can do to me, on a personal level, is concerning.”

Arkk nodded his head. “I am aware. Which is why we should do this under controlled circumstances with me—and that ice marble—present.” He took in a breath, letting it back out slowly. “I stopped by the Fortress the other day ago and checked up on things around there. Mostly her. She expressed interest in learning more about the Burning Forge. Most of her time has been spent inside the forge, molding little bits of metal into small sculptures.”

“And you wish for me to speak with her.”

“You know more than I do,” Arkk said with a shrug. “Better to get this over with sooner rather than later. If she *does* attack you… Well, I’m fairly certain that ice marble will kill her rather quickly, judging by how she acted in its presence the first time.”

“And you wish to do this now?”

Arkk nodded his head. “It is going to take some time for them to find the slavers. We’ve got until then.”

“If you think it is best,” Vezta said, her tone polite if slightly strained.

“I do. I think it is more than for the best. Agnete should be able to take the final spot in our ritual but… kind of need her willing. If she takes up an interest in the Pantheon, I feel like that is a good avenue to get her to agree despite any misgivings she might have over ‘forbidden’ magics.”

“When put like that, I can see the reasoning. Very well, Master. Back to the stayover?”

Arkk nodded his head. They had set up a teleportation circle inside the stayover, figuring it was less suspicious to have people disappear from within rather than heading out a half a day’s walk away from the burg to an unsheltered area where anyone with eyes could watch them disappear. Today, however, that meant they had to walk back into town.

Walking through the streets of Moonshine Burg with Vezta at his side had become something of a regular occurrence. He wanted to be sure that the inquisitors were aware of him and hadn’t tried hiding because of that. Still, people stopped what they were doing to stare. Even after weeks of being inside the burg, walking through the market caused a commotion.

It always started slow. Someone would notice Vezta and nudge someone they were standing near. Their actions would attract others who then attracted more. In a few moments, it felt like the entire market stopped what they were doing to stare. At least word had spread enough to avoid panicked people rushing to the guards. It still felt a bit… eerie.

Worst of all were a small number of the ones from Evestani. On the border of the two nations, Moonshine had accrued several residents from Evestani. Most were perfectly normal people who stopped and stared like everyone else. Yet there was a small subset with extravagant golden tattoos around the crowns of their heads who didn’t so much as stare as they *glowered*.

Pious of the Golden Order, according to a few locals who Arkk had asked. As far as Arkk could tell, the Golden Order was equivalent to the Abbey of the Light except native to Evestani. Given the relation, Arkk wasn’t too surprised by their more hostile interest in Vezta compared to the average citizen.

They were one of the main reasons Arkk wanted to finish up with this slaver business and then move away. Perhaps to one of the principalities, both of which were on the opposite side of the Duchy and thus as far from Evestani as possible. He already had one religious organization hounding him. Adding a second seemed like a bad idea.

Today especially felt unusual. It felt like there were more pious than usual. What was worse was the way they didn’t look like they had been participating in the usual market activities. They weren’t standing in lines, manning shops, peddling wares, or even proselytizing. It was almost like they had been sitting around, waiting. Now they all stared at him as one, heads turning all at the same time.

Yes. The sooner they could get out of Moonshine Burg, the better.

Reaching the Canyon’s End stayover, Arkk had to smile. Partially in relief at being out of the public eye, partially because of the feel of the stayover. The entire place had effectively been taken over by Company Al-Mir. Orcs sat at each of the tables. Some drinking and eating, others playing a variety of games, gambling what coin they hadn’t spent in the burg with each other. Only the occasional traveling merchants stopped by and often not for long.

Getting out of the fortress had done them some good, Arkk reflected. From what Dakka, Olatt’an, and Rekk’ar had mentioned among each other and his observations, there had been some amount of disconcertion regarding the handling of the inquisitors. Sending them into fights they could win, a place where they could spend coin, and just generally getting some fresh air had done wonders for morale.

To the best of his knowledge, there hadn’t been any altercations in the town involving the orcs either. That, especially, reassured Arkk that he had, in some way, rehabilitated the former raiders.

Up the stairs and beyond a door guarded by the other two gorgon, Arkk stepped into a complex ritual circle drawn on the ground. A touch of magic and Arkk found himself a day’s walk away from Moonshine Burg, nestled between a pair of craggy rocks. Two steps forward and he was in another ritual circle. It took *several* more hops—Moonshine Burg was by far the furthest he had ever been from Langleey—but he eventually found himself in one of the decrepit corridors of the trashed false fortress. From there, he simply used his abilities as Keeper of the Heart to transport himself into Fortress Al-Mir proper.

He took in a deep breath and let it out in a content sigh.

Home.

As he mentioned to Vezta, it had only been a few days. Still, knowing that the fortress was, in some way, literally him… he couldn’t help feeling that he didn’t belong far away from it.

Vezta, pulled from the false fortress, appeared at his side a few moments later.

“Savren and Zullie were arguing about something the other day,” he said. “Why not see if it is something you can resolve while I go and speak with Agnete… make sure she doesn’t incinerate you on sight.”

Vezta bowed. “Most magnificently magnanimous, my Master.”

Arkk leveled a glare at Vezta, not bothering to give her the satisfaction of commentary before sending her off toward the library.

People had been doing that more and more lately. Usually whenever Savren came up in conversation. He hoped it was just people mocking him but… perhaps he needed to take Zullie aside and ensure that Savren’s curse wasn’t spreading. Or that Savren wasn’t trying to spread his curse around as he had with the flawed ritual in Hope Village.

Arkk didn’t think he was doing the latter. Able to examine the entirety of the traversable areas of the fortress in only a few seconds, he couldn’t find any ritual circle like the one he had destroyed. It wasn’t possible to dig through the reinforced walls or floors either, leaving no possibility that Savren had somehow hidden a curse-spreading ritual somewhere out of sight. Still…

Shaking his head, making a note for later, Arkk moved himself in front of Agnete’s quarters.

Like most doors in Fortress Al-Mir, this door had been refurbished from one of the original doors left behind. Even now, he wasn’t *quite* sure about all the rules in this place. Gold could form entire rooms including furnishings or raw materials but not other things, like doors, which required skilled labor to produce from those raw materials. Yet the lesser servants could repair many existing things, like doors and floors and walls, all without consuming gold or raw materials. They just performed some magical dancing and everything came out brand new. There were limitations. Once something was destroyed beyond a reasonable point of repair, it would have to be replaced entirely.

That meant he only had a limited number of doors to move around before he would have to occupy blacksmith time with making new ones. If he wanted wooden doors, he would have to recruit John’s assistance as well. So far, that hadn’t been an issue.

*So far*…

The metal frame of Agnete’s door sagged and drooped, barely managing to hold in the wooden boards. The wood wasn’t really wood so much either. Rather, it had turned to a brittle, black charcoal. The lesser servant was trying to perform its magic. That was probably the only reason the door was still intact but it looked like a losing battle.

“Do the best you can,” Arkk said to the poor bundle of pulsating black slime, mouths, and eyes.

He would have to see about getting the door replaced. Maybe Savren or Zullie could figure out a way of making the doors magically resistant to heat.

In the meantime, Arkk retrieved a thick leather glove from the smithy and gently knocked on the door.

The wooden panels crumbled under his touch. Even with as light a knock as he could manage, the panel he touched fell apart. The one next to it fell as well, then the next one over. The chain reaction spread through the door until it was nothing but a cloud of ashy dust. The warped bits of metal clattered to the floor around his feet. Hot, dry air rushed out, enveloping him.

The lesser servant looked up at him. It wasn’t human. It didn’t have a human face let alone the ability to make anything resembling a recognizable expression. He still felt the withering look it gave him, like he had just wasted all its efforts at keeping the door intact.

“Sorry,” Arkk said.

“It was my fault.”

Glancing up, Arkk found Agnete standing at the back of the room, just beyond the cracked throne, staring into a large mirror that hadn’t been present the last time Arkk visited her room. She looked… calmer than when Arkk last saw her. Her muscled back wasn’t as tense as before.

Arkk, blinking, realized he could see her muscled back. “Sorry,” Arkk said again. “I didn’t mean to just barge in. The door—”

“I noticed its state the other day,” Agnete said, turning. She knelt down next to the large throne and popped open a large stone chest that matched with the cracked and molten throne. Withdrawing a long black overcoat, she threw it on and began buttoning up the front. “Since then, I have been trying to rein myself in. This place is freedom unlike any I have experienced—slight elevation in ambient temperature would have the inquisitors *upset* with me—but I suppose there is cause for restraint even now.”

“That’s good. I’m honestly not sure how to handle you. I would rather not be comparable to the likes of Darius Vrox but at the same time, I would prefer the fortress intact.” Arkk reached out with the glove, snapping a piece of the frame off the wall with little effort. He tossed it to the lesser servant, who formed a mouth in just the right spot and swallowed it whole. “I’ll see about getting a more durable door put in instead. A solid metal one.”

Turning back to Agnete, Arkk stumbled in place. Her face was turned toward the door now. The glowing lines on her face and bright embers in the depths of her pupils made his heart skip a beat. It was no wonder people ran from him when he made his eyes glow if *that* was what greeted them. But Agnete wasn’t staring at him. Her eyes were on the lesser servant, watching with intent as it consumed the remainder of the door.

“The horror from beyond the stars…”

“Vezta would be upset to hear that.”

Glowing eyes flicked over to Arkk as Agnete raised a questioning eyebrow.

“Vezta is my… assistant? She calls herself a servant. This is just a lesser servant. Vezta is the pre-Calamity monster that you inquisitors have been so upset about.” Arkk knelt to pat the lesser servant on its… itself. “She looks more human though. In fact, she is an almost duplicate of the little tailor servant you met when you first arrived.”

“It bit me.”

Arkk let out a small chuckle, thinking back. He had been watching when that happened. If he remembered right, Agnete had been poking and prodding the lesser servant. Probably trying to figure out what it was.

“They’ve been avoiding me,” Agnete said, interrupting Arkk’s reminiscing. “I’ve *felt* them around but every time I turn my head, they’re gone. *These* are the horrors from beyond the stars? But it is… cute. Not how Greesom described them at all.”

Arkk snapped his head over to Agnete, both eyebrows climbing up his forehead. While he had long since gotten used to them, calling them cute was a bit much. And this was the first time she was seeing them. Everyone else had strong words to say about them, even if they also got used to them eventually.

Ilya still didn’t like them.

“Why do the inquisitors call them horrors from beyond the stars? Vezta has quite a negative view on that term.”

“Horror?”

“No. The beyond the stars part. I think she would prefer horror *from* the stars.” Arkk shrugged. “I don’t really get it either but the distinction seems important to her. How did the inquisitors come by the name?”

Agnete slowly shook her head. “I told you when you offered me your false choice, I have never been privy to the operations of the inquisitors. I believe you put it best when you said that I was little more than an attack dog on a leash.”

“Ah—”

“However, I can make guesses. We are dispatched by Oracles. I know little about them other than their supposed prophetic visions, which are what direct the inquisitors as a whole. I understand that a vision directed the inquisitors to me in my youth.” She paused, eyes losing focus for a long moment before she shook her head, sending her wild dark hair thrashing around her. “My only real experience with such visions comes from Greesom. He could receive lesser revelation. Vague and imprecise, interpreting it nonetheless brought us to several incidents.”

“That… sounds familiar. I think Vrox mentioned these oracles to me before.”

“I am not sure what transpired. We were on another assignment, investigating an issue in the Kingdom’s southern desert when we received urgent orders to head up to the Duchy. Immediately. We abandoned our then-current assignment without resolution and relocated to find you.”

“And Vezta…”

“Judging by the urgency, it is unlikely the inquisitors will give up. With my presence, they may elevate this issue to a full crisis and send more than just a single inquisitor, a chronicler, and a purifier.”

Arkk nodded, leaning up against the doorframe. “Yeah. I figured something like that would happen. I’m hoping I’ve thrown them off the track a bit. I told Vrox that I would be abandoning the area they found me in. Then, this last week or so, I and Vezta have been very visible on the far side of the Duchy, making sure everyone has seen us moving around. I’ve even asked Vezta to unleash some of her tentacles as we walked around some of the larger burgs, just to get rumors flying around.”

“That may work for a time. Greesom’s visions are vague and difficult to understand. They pointed us in the right direction but then we had to rely on information gathering from villagers and other local avenues. But I doubt your efforts will be a permanent solution.”

“Yeah. I figured that as well.”

“I will fight,” Agnete said, squaring her shoulders as she stared at Arkk. “Or I will die. Unfortunately, I am not the only purifier among the ranks of the inquisitors. The Binder you took from Vrox is not the only one. My efforts against them will be limited.”

“I’m hoping to have a more permanent solution. Or… at least more help. I’m preparing a large ritual,” Arkk started, taking the opportunity to shift the topic back to one of his original purposes in coming here. “One that, while forbidden magics, I’m sure, will hopefully be a first step in changing the world for the better. In addition, it might let you find out more about the Burning Forge and… what made you *you*. Would you like to hear about it?”

Agnete stared for a long moment before dipping her head in a brief nod.

## 57 - Readying Up


“You received some letters. Came in by Swiftwing Harpies.”

Arkk barely stepped out of the newly fashioned teleportation circle inside the Moonshine camp before being practically assaulted by Ilya waving a set of neatly folded letters in front of his face. One letter had an obvious seal stamped into wax while the other only had a glob keeping it closed. Taking them, he frowned down at both for just a moment before tucking them into his inner jacket pocket.

“That’s good. It means people know we’re here.”

He didn’t have time to examine them. Arkk had to step out of the teleportation circle and further into the large tent set up outside Moonshine Burg. The ritual circle pulsed and Agnete appeared within its confines. The temperature of the tent immediately shifted from a chill winter’s morning to a hot summer afternoon, making Arkk, Dakka, and several of the other gathered orcs break out in sweat.

Rekk’ar, already present having come through the teleportation circle before Arkk, just crossed his arms. He was finally out of that sling. It was thanks to him that Ilya and the others had gathered.

While at Fortress Al-Mir, Arkk made a sudden realization. Rekk’ar had left the fortress only once since first being hired. That one time had been a temporary departure when Arkk called for reinforcements at Darkwood, defending the town from the other Keeper. There was always some problem going on but Rekk’ar spent his time at the fortress, making sure to keep everything in line. It was high time that he got out to fight and war and just get a breath of fresh air. Maybe it would make him less cranky. With Vezta staying back at the fortress with the two warlocks and their research—and the fortress being nearly empty—Arkk was hoping this little excursion would help alleviate some of Rekk’ar’s concerns in addition to getting him out and moving about.

Agnete, on the other hand, was here solely because *she* wanted to be here. Arkk hadn’t offered. She had asked. She wanted to see how Arkk ran things, what kind of person he was outside their limited prior interactions, and how the others in his employ acted. Arkk didn’t have much of a reason to keep her in the fortress. With her abilities, it would only make their upcoming task all the easier to accomplish.

“Come along,” Arkk said, moving from the large tent across their small camp on the open plains and to a smaller tent with several cots set inside.

Arkk looked around the new tent, locking eyes with Edvin and the gremlin at his side. Lexa. The only non-employee in the area. 

Gremlins stood shorter than most other races. Half the height of an average human left the gremlin utterly dwarfed by all the orcs filing inside, though her spiked mass of bright red hair helped to make her look a *little* less short than she actually was. That probably wasn’t the only reason she looked distinctly uncomfortable. Being the only fully-fledged bandit among a group of mercenaries had her clearly on guard. Not that there was much she would be able to do if Arkk did suddenly decide to throw her to the local garrison.

Looking away from the two, Arkk found Ilya’s silver eyes. “Report,” he said. “Did you find the slavers?”

Ilya shot a glance in Lexa’s direction as well, nodding at the same time. “We managed to track them down two days ago. They are about two days out from here, making their home in an abandoned outpost from the last war as Lexa indicated.”

“Would it be too much to ask for the Duchy to hold onto its territory?” Arkk asked with a sigh. “I suppose this isn’t the first time we’re cleaning up the Duchy’s mess. Were you able to scry on this outpost?”

Grimacing, Ilya nodded her head. “It… It isn’t pretty. The outpost has an entire dungeon set up. Probably for holding onto prisoners from the war but… now… it’s holding onto slaves. They have these massive carts drawn by massive horned creatures. Each cart has stacks upon stacks of large metal cages. I think they take them around to the places they raid, fill them up then drag them back here. Some of the slaves are treated better than others—probably the ones they want to sell for looks rather than labor—but it is a mess all around.”

“How many slavers?”

“There are about two-hundred cots in their barracks.”

“Two hundred?” Arkk repeated with a frown. That… was a fair amount. They only had eighteen orcs now that Rekk’ar and a few of the others who had been at the fortress were with them. Plus himself, Ilya, four gorgon, and Agnete. And Edvin, he supposed, though he wasn’t going to expect much from the highwayman.

He had fought off about that many goblins when he first met Vezta. That had been an entirely different situation, with them all rushing toward him—meaning only a limited number could engage with him at any given time—and him not having to worry much about innocents getting in the way. Here, they had slaves who would turn into hostages the moment things took a dive for the slavers.

For a few moments, he considered returning to the fortress to retrieve Vezta, Zullie, and Savren. Maybe the other gorgon as well. Looking to his side, where Agnete had taken up a position a little too close for comfort, he shook his head. Himself, Ilya, four gorgon, and Agnete were probably enough to take on eighty entrenched slavers on their own. Sure, most of that might have been Agnete, but still…

“Dakka,” Arkk said, looking at the orc. She stiffened under his gaze, back straightening. “You’ve been informed of the situation?”

“I was watching them scry it, Sir.”

“Good. Take Rekk’ar and Agnete, get them fully up to speed on what is going on and start coming up with strategies. Vezta and our warlocks are available if we feel it is necessary. I’ll join you shortly.”

Dakka’s eyes shifted over to Rekk’ar. There was a certain pride to her gaze as her lips curled into a smile. “Yes, Sir,” she said.

“The rest of you, get everything ready to move. Jorr’or, check our food and medical supplies. Make sure we have some extra of both, enough to help anyone we rescue. You have full authority to take as much gold into town as is required to procure the necessary supplies.”

The orc who had acted as quartermaster on this excursion nodded his head before turning to the flaps of the tent. Everyone else filed out in short order, leaving just Arkk and Ilya behind in the large barracks-like tent. It wasn’t the best home base, but they didn’t have anywhere else unless they wanted to take another hop to the stayover. Although more effective than walking, moving people one at a time through the teleportation circle wasn’t a very effective means of travel or he might have suggested they return to Fortress Al-Mir every night. It was just easier to rent out the entire stayover and use this camp.

“Vezta didn’t come back with you?” Ilya asked as they took a seat on one of the nearby cots.

“There were some problems with Zullie and Savren. Wanted to make sure they didn’t end up killing each other, so she’s mediating.”

“Problems?”

“Disagreements over changes to the ritual circle. As interested as I am, I didn’t ask. Too much other stuff going on. After setting Vezta to loom over their shoulders, they actually started cooperating instead of just arguing about it. I sat in on a few of their sessions but…” Arkk hung his head. “It’s complicated. I wish I had more time to fully learn everything but I’ve got to run around plotting assaults on slavers.”

Lips pressed together, Ilya reached out, resting a hand on Arkk’s knee. “This is important too. Just think of all the people we’re helping. And all the people who won’t have to worry about being raided in the future because these slime will be dead.”

“I know,” Arkk said. “I’m not saying it isn’t important or we’ll leave those people.” Shaking his head, Arkk focused. “With the inquisitors lurking in places we can’t scry, I just was hoping we could find some spellcasters out here. Sadly, I doubt many, if any, of the slaves will be casters.”

“What about—”

“I can cast spells.”

Arkk blinked and looked over Ilya’s shoulder. Lexa leaned up against the central pole holding up the tent. The short gremlin hadn’t left with the others and Arkk hadn’t even noticed. He was so used to looking up that he had entirely forgotten to look down, despite having singled her out earlier. It didn’t help that she had half-hidden behind the large pole, barely visible from his position.

Discussing sensitive things without fully securing the area…

“You can cast spells?” Arkk asked, trying to maintain a neutral tone of voice.

“Nothing flashy,” the gremlin said, grinning with sharp teeth. “A few tricks here or there. Distract a mark or make me harder to notice. It worked on you. Useful, right?”

Arkk narrowed his eyes. Maybe he hadn’t simply overlooked the gremlin. “And you’re offering your services.”

“Consider this my demonstration of ability.” Shoving off the pole, Lexa walked around it and stopped in front of Arkk. “I’m a thief. Best in the business. At least around these parts. I can slip through cracks most others wouldn’t even notice, I can hide in plain sight, and I can nick valuables right out from under people’s noses.” Pulling a hand from behind her back, she waved two familiar letters back and forth.

Arkk stiffened, reaching into his jacket even as Ilya’s arm shot out. She snatched all the letters from the gremlin’s small hand. Not that the gremlin even tried to withhold them. Lexa just flashed her sharp teeth again.

“When did you—”

“Magic,” Lexa said, wiggling her fingers. “Not going to say more than that unless you hire me.”

“Bad first impression,” Ilya snapped. “What else have you stolen?”

“Nothing, nothing at all. I did snoop around,” she admitted. “Peeked into a few bags here or there. Spotted some interesting magic circles in the guarded tent… Left everything right where I found it.”

Arkk stiffened at the mention of the teleportation circle. That was one of his biggest advantages and not something he wanted to give up. Especially not to bandits.

“Sure you did.” Ilya’s disbelief came through as clear in her tone as it was written on her face, patting herself down to check that she wasn’t missing anything else.

Arkk held up a hand. “And you’ve, what, tired of your thieving career? Want to turn over a new leaf?” If she wasn’t offering to work for him now… He wasn’t quite sure what he would have done. Secrecy was security and security was paramount.

“Never. My skills are handy no matter the situation. Handier than a bunch of ex-raiders, anyway. Now I hear you’re in the market for spellcasters too? That just makes me more valuable.” She laughed a sharp, high-pitched laugh. “Don’t get me wrong. I love what I do. Kat’s Bandits are a nice family—Kat is sexy and perfectly happy to share herself with anyone who pleases her—but after snooping around here and seeing how much coin you’ve got to throw around? Well, if I knew how well being a mercenary paid, I’d have joined a company years ago.”

Of all the topics he had discussed with Hawkwood during his visit to Cliff City, pay had not been among them. He honestly doubted that most other free companies could afford to give a gold coin to each employee every month. Fortress Al-Mir put him in a league of his own when it came to what he could offer his workers.

“You can’t just—”

Holding up a hand, Arkk stalled Ilya’s retort. “What assurances would I have that you aren’t going to take the coin and run back to your outlaw friends?”

“We’re not hiring *another* criminal, are we?” Ilya asked before Lexa could say anything.

Arkk shrugged. “We already knew we weren’t going to find any spellcasters in good standing. That pretty much leaves *only* criminals.”

“If I’m working for a free company, I’m not a criminal, now am I?” the gremlin grinned. “As for assurances… the only assurance out there is gold. As long as the gold keeps coming and nobody offers me a better deal, I’m yours. For whatever. You. Want.” Lexa hooked a finger over the front of her bodice and lightly pulled, showing off just enough skin to be enticing without showing off everything.

Arkk locked his eyes with her hazel slit pupils and frowned. “I’m not in the habit of abusing my employees like that.”

“It isn’t abuse if—”

“I also prefer women who are taller than me.”

Ilya, who had been glaring at Lexa, shifted her glare over to Arkk before moving back to the gremlin. She stared back and forth like she wasn’t sure who was more deserving of her ire. When Arkk flashed her a smile and winked, she rolled her eyes and shook her head.

“Ah,” Lexa said, looking between the two as she slumped her shoulders. “Kind of rude to put it like that but maybe I can change your mind later. I’m more after the gold anyway.”

Reaching into his pocket, Arkk withdrew a single gold coin. Holding it up, he watched as Lexa’s eyes went wide, following its motions like a cat ready to pounce on a rat.

“I’ll hire you,” Arkk said, moving the coin back and forth. “A gold coin a month, plus bonuses for combat or other situations that require your skills or presence. While employed, you don’t steal from regular people or anyone else under my employ.”

Although her eyes kept following the gold coin, her head turned slightly toward Arkk. “No one? What defines ‘regular people’? What about rich idiots begging to have some of their wealth redistributed? The tax collector, maybe? Does it count as stealing if they’re dead?”

“No murdering people either,” Arkk said, narrowing his eyes.

“I didn’t mean *that*. Just suppose I’m walking around, minding my own business, when I stumble across an old mausoleum filled with all kinds of shiny things…”

“Look. I just don’t want you acting like a thug. I’m still trying to build up Company Al-Mir’s reputation. If you do anything to tear that down, we’re going to have a problem. Clear?”

“Crystal.”

With a slight sigh, Arkk held out the coin. It vanished from his fingers in the blink of an eye and disappeared down the front of her shirt—she must have had a pocket sewn in there—not via magic, just the quick reflexes of the gremlin. While Lexa didn’t seem to notice, Arkk felt the minion bond form between them.

“Don’t worry,” Lexa said, eyes back on him while she showed off her sharp-toothed grin. “You won’t regret this.”

“I hope not. Now get prepared to head out with the others.”

“You can order me around however you want,” she said, turning on her heel.

Arkk watched her go, making sure she didn’t slip off to spy on them a second time. She must have known that he was watching because she started swinging her hips in what Arkk had to *hope* was an exaggerated manner. It couldn’t be comfortable to walk like that all the time.

“Lexa,” Arkk called out before she made it to the tent flaps, a thought occurring to him.

She paused and turned, raising a bright red eyebrow.

“Are there other spellcasters among Kat’s Bandits?”

“Oh yeah. Kat herself is one. Then there’s Roland, Hestia, Marg, and maybe a few others? Not sure how good they are. None of us have any professional training. Just the books we… liberated from our customers.”

“I see…”

“You want a full list? Every spell they know—or every spell I know they know, anyway.”

“Later, perhaps.”

“Sure thing.” With one last sashay, Lexa slipped out of the room.

Arkk hummed to himself, mind churning as he considered possible future interactions with Katja and her crew. With these slavers being a thorn in Katja’s side, taking them out should engender some feelings of gratitude. He wasn’t sure that they would all be as willing to jump ship—especially not the leader—but if he could borrow a few spellcasters for however long the ritual would require…

“You aren’t seriously thinking about hiring them all, are you? I can’t believe how many criminals we have working with us.”

“If they’re working for us, they aren’t causing problems for villages and travelers.”

“That’s the same logic we used on the orcs and Savren and the gorgon and now these thieves. I’m not sure how much I like that argument.”

“It’s all gone well so far,” Arkk said with a shake of his head. “We’ll talk it over later. I doubt they’ll all even want to join up. For now, I’m curious about these.”

Holding up the letters Ilya had handed him, he broke the wax seal on the one without a signet stamped into it. It was the thickest of the two, containing a great many pages. Sketches and diagrams of buildings and murals. The front letter, after Arkk skimmed it, filled him in on what it was all about.

“Ah. That expedition we helped with. This is the historian getting back to me.”

“Back to you?”

“I waived half their pay in exchange for details on the ruins they were heading to. I thought it might have been another fortress like Al-Mir. Judging by this giant pit, I might have been right, though it fits with Vezta’s description of a dead fortress. Interesting but not all that exciting. I’ll look over his other notes later.”

The next letter, stamped with the upward chevron seal of White Company, was a letter from Hawkwood. This one wasn’t a particularly long letter but the content had Arkk sitting forward in his seat.

“It seems like we *have* made a splash among those who pay attention to mercenaries. Hawkwood is congratulating us for saving Silver City and ridding Savren’s magic from Hope. He’s mentioned us around and…” Arkk pressed his lips together. “Seems like he wants to invite us to a small dinner in Cliff, accompanied by several other mercenary company commanders.”

Ilya crossed her arms, closing her eyes. “Is that all?”

Arkk flipped the letter over, checking the backside, before shrugging. “Looks like it.”

“It’s a trap. The inquisitors got to him. Or the entire letter is forged.”

Arkk drummed his fingers on his knee. The thought had occurred to him but… “I don’t want to believe that.”

“What else could it be?”

“Just what it says. I’ve had several correspondences with Hawkwood since we met for the first time. He mentioned things like this before. All the company leaders are friends, though some consider other companies to be friendly rivals. It’s… not out of the ordinary to be invited along with them.” Arkk paused then looked Ilya in her silver eyes. “We *have* been making a name for ourselves.”

“Even if the inquisitors have nothing to do with it, they are still there. You can’t seriously be considering going. They won’t just ignore you.”

“They might,” Arkk said, knowing damn well they wouldn’t. “I asked John to visit Stone Hearth and Smilesville while I was back at the fortress. Neither place has any bounty, notice, or other declaration of interest regarding me, Company Al-Mir, or even the Cursed Forest.”

“Because they’re trying to draw you in with this letter!” Ilya snapped standing up. “Arkk. Ask *any* of the others. Rekk’ar. Olatt’an. Vezta. Zullie. Savren. Dakka. *Edvin*. They’ll all tell you this is a trap.”

Arkk closed his eyes, nodding his head. He did not doubt that. He wasn’t even disagreeing. He didn’t think… He *hoped* that Hawkwood hadn’t tried to trap him. That didn’t mean that the inquisitors wouldn’t hear about his arrival and try to do something then.

Still… This could well be the last chance they had to visit Cliff without being labeled as heretics or traitors. The last chance they would have to get Alya out of the Duke’s manor while still able to freely move about the city. If he brought up that point, Ilya might change her mind.

He wasn’t sure if he should or not. She might *insist* they go, which Arkk wasn’t sure he wanted. Or she might not, feeling she would have to abandon her mother. Arkk didn’t want that either. It wouldn’t be a good feeling.

“We’ll discuss it later,” Arkk said, folding the letter and sliding it back into his pocket. He would have to think it over. “It doesn’t matter now. We’ve got this counter-slaver operation to deal with.”

Ilya stared a moment before letting out a small breath, blowing a loose lock of her silver hair aside. “Twenty-five versus two-hundred, can we do it?”

“To be honest, unless these slavers have a secret inquisitor up their sleeve with an ice marble, I think Agnete could handle them entirely on her own.”

“Without incinerating the slaves?”

Arkk pressed his lips into a thin smile, lightly touching the round lump in his pocket just to make sure *that* hadn’t gone missing. “That’s why the rest of us are going.”

## 58 - Slavers


When Arkk had been told that the slavers were held up in an old military outpost, he had expected some kind of fortress. Like the garrison at Cliff, with tall stone walls and observation turrets at the corners, or even like the bandit encampment and its imposing spiked defenses and tall wooden walls. Instead, he was greeted with a squat brick wall that he could probably see over just by jumping—Ilya and the orcs wouldn’t have a problem in the slightest. The wall wasn’t even thick. Shoving his shoulder against it a few times might not make it move but gather up three orcs and put them in roughly the same spot? They would knock it over in a few seconds.

Although the wall was unimpressive, it was a *large* compound. In the war, it must have been used as a staging point. A whole army could fit inside those thin walls. Given the wide open area lacking in buildings, they likely would have been expected to use tents. That was what the slavers were doing now, in any case. There were a few actual structures, all of which had been built into the walls. It was within those that most of the slaves were being kept.

Scrying on the camp for the previous day got them some information. There were about one hundred and fifty slavers present, all outfitted for combat. They had about an equal number of slaves crammed into the buildings. Most were occupying floor space but there were a number chained to the walls—presumably troublemakers.

Out in front of the outpost, which sat on a fairly flat plain covered in a light dusting of snow, was something Arkk had never seen before. Four great beasts, each towering over the rest of the outpost. Their massive bodies, covered in thick, rough hide, looked like they could crush an orc and barely notice what they stepped on. Even from his vantage point well away from the outpost, Arkk could *feel* their steps as they meandered about their makeshift pasture. More imposing were the large spiked horns that jutted up from their snouts.

Despite their awe-inspiring appearance, they didn’t look like they were used in combat. The pasture was right next to four equally massive carts. He wasn’t quite sure *how* big they were—the size of the beasts nearby was playing havoc on his sense of scale—but each of those carts contained twelve rectangular metal cages. Judging by their profession, those cages were probably the size of humans, if not orcs.

“Rhinos,” Olatt’an said, unprompted. “I’ve encountered the beasts before. They look frightening, but they are surprisingly docile. Unless you provoke them. In that case, you’re going to have a bad time.”

“I bet,” Arkk said, lowering the crystal ball to look across the plain with his own eyes. Despite the size of the beasts, they weren’t quite as easy to spot. Their black hides blended in with the night too well. “They’re why we’re approaching from the opposite side. It’s just that feeling the ground as they move… Avoid them if possible.”

“And if it isn’t possible?” Rekk’ar asked.

Olatt’an snorted. “Run.”

“Can the gorgon stone them?” Arkk asked, looking to Zharja.

The black-scaled gorgon let out a long, thoughtful hiss before slowly shaking her head. “Their eyess are on sseperate ssidess of their headss.”

“Is that a problem?”

“Yess,” she said, offering no elaboration.

“As I said, they’re not aggressive beasts. Make noise and they’ll likely scatter,” Olatt’an said. “The ones you have to watch out for are the slavers whipping them into a frenzy.”

“Right. Lexa,” Arkk said. “Change of plans. You’re going to protect the rhinos. Take out anyone who looks like they’re trying to get them fighting us. Can you manage?”

“Sounds easier than what you wanted me doing before,” the gremlin said with her sharp-toothed grin.

“Good.”

“Mind if I head out? Bit of a trek to the opposite side of the outpost with these short legs of mine.”

Arkk nodded his head. “If things seem calm or you take out everyone heading to the rhinos, go back to the original plan, if possible. Otherwise, just cause as much havoc as you can.”

“Righty-oh,” Lexa said, tapping her fingers to her brow in a sloppy salute. Turning, she hurried off into the night, making even less noise than Ilya as she ran.

Arkk watched her go for a moment, frowning.

“Can we trust that one?”

Arkk shrugged at Rekk’ar’s question. “She accepted a coin, so she is a proper employee.” This meant that Arkk could watch her no matter where she was, though that was a secret he was still keeping from everyone except Vezta. “If she does turn traitor, I imagine it will be as a spy for Katja later on. Katja wants these slavers gone. I doubt we have to worry about her sabotaging us right now.”

“I’ll be keeping an eye on her.”

“You keep an eye on a lot of people,” Arkk quipped. “Running out of eyes?”

“And you’re too trusting. Even with one eye on others, I’ve still gone one to watch where I’m going. If you take a knife in your back, that’s your only back.”

Arkk pressed his lips into a thin line, staring at the green-skinned orc for a long moment. It took a moment to parse that analogy and he wasn’t sure that it was any good. Even if it was, it didn’t exactly apply to him. The power of Fortress Al-Mir let him observe his employees from anywhere at any time, effectively granting him an infinite number of eyes. Even that wasn’t necessary given that the Heart should alert him if anyone tried to betray him, much as it had warned him that a prisoner bond broke. Technically, he hadn’t tested that feature yet.

Yet…

Looking over Rekk’ar’s shoulder, Arkk found Edvin gesticulating wildly as he chatted with a nearby orc. From the way he was acting, the highwayman was regaling the orc with a tale of intense battle. Probably a very tall tale.

Well, there was a first time for everything.

Testing that betrayal warning was half his reason for keeping Edvin around at this point. Nobody had a positive word to say about the man and Arkk felt betrayal was inevitable, just as soon as Edvin felt he could get away without being chased down. Perhaps during a bout of intense combat.

Which was fine. The man had no important role to play this evening. As long as he didn’t try to literally stab Arkk in his back during his flight from their organization, Arkk was content to use him as a test.

Movement drew Arkk’s eyes away from the potential deserter, back toward the outpost. Ilya, long silver hair tied up in a small bun to keep it out of the way during the fight, came running up to their encampment. She gave Arkk a sharp nod of her head, fingers tightening around the grip of her black bow.

“The watch has been taken out,” Ilya said.

“No one noticed?”

“Not yet.”

“Good,” Arkk said, standing and turning.

Twenty orcs stared back. Almost every orc from the fortress. Six gorgon stood among them—the four he had originally brought along with two more he had invited over just to make sure everything went smoothly. Vezta wasn’t present. Neither were Savren or Zullie. After discussing the strategy with his advisors, they judged their presence unnecessary. Arkk would rather have them working on making the adjustments to the ritual anyway. It seemed like it was going to take longer than expected so the more time they had to work on it, the better.

Agnete hung close to him, the heat she put off strangely comfortable in the chill night air. She hadn’t said much and didn’t look like she was going to say much. Somewhat like Edvin, this was a test for her. Arkk had the little ice marble safe in his pocket, just in case, but was hoping he wouldn’t need to use it.

There was one additional member of their group tonight. One who had only been made an employee this morning. Standing hunched over just apart from the rest, a werecat with mangy orange fur had her lips parted in a permanent snarl. Although her face was mostly humanoid, her sharp teeth and heavy breathing had the orcs nearby shooting wary glances in her direction. That wasn’t helped by the way the moonlight gleamed off her orange eyes, making them glow bright despite the lack of any other light source.

She wasn’t fully healed. The end of her tail and one arm were wrapped up in white linen. The arm that wasn’t bandaged had a thick chain dangling from her wrist. Thus far, she had resisted any attempts at having it removed. Her body was far thinner than Arkk had seen among the few werecats around Cliff City, making him think that she still needed to eat a lot more.

She didn’t talk much. At least she wasn’t trying to attack them. Arkk had a small doubt in the back of his mind that Savren’s mind magics had a permanent effect but the warlock insisted that he had only calmed her. Prying out her name, Lyssa, had taken some effort which did serve to reassure Arkk. The only thing she wanted, as far as Arkk could tell, was a chance for revenge.

As long as her feral fury was aimed at his enemies, Arkk was happy to facilitate that revenge.

“Everyone knows their roles,” Arkk said, looking over the orc-dominated group. “I’d give a rallying speech but you don’t want that, do you? Watch each other. Help each other. Come back alive. That’s all I’ll say.

“Olatt’an. Get your group in position. Rekk’ar, Zharja. Get moving. Dakka, Agnete, with me. Everyone, wait for my signal.”

Orders given, the three groups split off from one another. They weren’t going far, but they had a plan. Olatt’an was in charge of a handful of orcs who wielded crossbows, Ilya as well. Rekk’ar commanded the majority of the orcs this time instead of Dakka, solely to make sure that he had an important role. The gorgon followed Zharja—Arkk felt that having one of their own give them commands was for the best—but they were mixed in with Rekk’ar’s group along with both Edvin and Lyssa.

Arkk with Dakka and Agnete as bodyguards were on their own for the moment.

Each corner of the compound, while lacking tall brick turrets, did have elevated wooden platforms that allowed guards to keep watch on their surroundings. With Ilya having taken out all the guards on watch on this side of the compound, Arkk had little to fear from simply walking right up to the wall. It was even more pathetic up close. How long ago had it been abandoned? Thirty years or so? Some parts of the crumbling wall looked like they had been patched up recently. Even still, it was in a sorry state. Maybe the slavers didn’t intend to stick around. Maybe they just hadn’t gotten to it yet. In Arkk’s opinion, securing the outpost would have been among the first tasks he would have ordered unless something truly vital was needed. Like food.

Given how many people were inside the walls, maybe securing a source of food was a dire problem.

Whatever the case, the decrepit architecture worked to his advantage tonight. Over the years, the windswept plains had piled up dirt at the base of the wall, giving him even easier access than he would otherwise have. It took no effort for him or Agnete to vault over the top. He was a little worried that Dakka, being much larger than they were, would break the wall and cause a bunch of noise when she followed. She did stumble a bit but a steadying hand from Arkk kept the noise to a minimum.

Neither said a word. Arkk remained silent as well. Not now, not this close to their opponents. They simply nodded and moved.

The inner compound was a field of tents. Varying sizes of canvas-covered dwellings covered the empty… was it a courtyard? Given the lack of buildings, except for the two built into the one wall, this must have been how it had been used during the war. A hastily constructed outpost to serve as a waystation or logistical stopping point. Not a permanent dwelling or fortification.

Arkk had memorized the route he planned to take during the day’s scrying. He slipped between a few smaller tents, took a circuitous route around the array of barracks tents, and finally stopped at one of the larger tents toward the center of the compound. He held open the flap and let Dakka duck inside. Tossing a glance around, making sure nobody had seen them, he followed.

Dakka had explained a little bit about how she and the other orcs operated while raiding. Everyone had their own gear and weapons, mostly looted, and never parted with their belongings. They each maintained their blades and armor to the best of their abilities. Sometimes, heavier damage might require going to someone who knew more, but it was best to have something valuable to trade. Otherwise, anytime they did part with their gear, they were at risk of having stuff stolen by the others. Though she had admitted that maybe that was something unique to her situation, being the runt of the group.

Here, among the slavers, the situation seemed different. In this large tent, several wooden racks contained a vast plethora of weapons and armor. Chains, whips, swords, pikes, bows, quivers and arrows, and plenty more besides. Arkk was sure there would be plenty of weapons among the sleeping slavers but if they could deny this communal armory, that might result in a whole lot more people surrendering. The more who surrendered, the less likely something would go wrong.

Pulling out a moderately sized metal rod, Arkk started dragging it through the dirt. It wasn’t the most complex of arrays. The tracking spell was probably at a higher level. Still, it was something he wouldn’t have been able to create before Zullie’s lessons. It wasn’t something he had just copied from a book. Rather, he had specifically designed this ritual just for tonight. That alone made this a bit more special.

Especially with what he was about to do next.

Agnete simply watched. Although magically powerful, she didn’t actually know much about magic. Her flames were more akin to beastman magic. Rather than require incantations or complex designs to use, her flames were more instinctive. And limited. No matter how hard she tried, she wouldn’t be able to conjure a lightning bolt. As such, her curiosity over the pattern he was drawing was understandable.

After dragging a line from the circle at the center of the tent to each of its corners, he quickly approached the front flap. Dakka, who had been peering outside from a thin crack, gave him a nod of her head. He couldn’t see her face, hidden underneath her imposing black helmet, but the nod was enough.

Darting outside, he quickly ran to one of the exterior corners and started dragging the line out to another tent. This tent held more weaponry, some of a much higher quality than the others. He figured the leaders of the slavers would keep the best gear for themselves—and, importantly, on their persons—but getting rid of this would help.

It was a bit of a shame that he couldn’t take them for himself. He didn’t *need* the weapons and armor, not right now, but while Company Al-Mir had started as a front for getting into one of the Duke’s parties, the idea of running a mercenary company had grown on him. Arkk actually felt like he was doing good out in the Duchy, unlike some other elements he could name. Sure, he still planned to get rid of the Duke if he could and then there were the complications of tying his company to the fortress—not to mention Vezta and the Calamity stuff—but the thought of expanding Company Al-Mir into a proper mercenary force did appeal to him and weapons would help with that.

It was a bit disappointing that they had such little luck in recruiting from Moonshine Burg. Most who were capable of mercenary work were already employed with the garrison and didn’t have much interest in traveling. A few, Arkk had turned away simply because they looked more like accountants than proper fighters.

Finishing the ritual circle at the smaller tent, Arkk returned to the main armory tent and dragged out two more lines to either side of the largest barracks tent. He worked in silence, taking even more care here to not wake anyone on the other side of the thin canvas wall. This part of the job did have him feeling a little conflicted. He wouldn’t describe any fight he had been in as glamorous or honorable. Those were words for bards and stories. Still, fighting someone in proper combat was a far cry from what he was doing. Then again, thinking about the state of Lyssa or those slaves over in the buildings across the compound offered some solace.

Arkk started back toward the armory tent for the final line when a footstep that wasn’t his or Dakka’s ground against the earth.

“Hey! What are—”

Turning, Arkk made it just in time to watch a headless body thump against the ground. The decapitated head, flung from the blade of Dakka’s axe, slid along the ground until it caught on the canvas of a nearby tent.

For a long moment, neither of them moved. Arkk didn’t even breathe. As he listened to his surroundings, he did a quick check-up on all the others through their employee links. Olatt’an and the others in the ranged squad were perched atop the actual buildings, ready to support those on the ground while also keeping slavers from going after the slaves in retaliation or for hostages. Rekk’ar, Zharja, and the others were over the wall at the end of the compound, just awaiting his signal. Lexa was in the process of wiping blood from a short dagger on the body of a man who had his throat slit. Some kind of magical haze surrounded her. It wouldn’t render her invisible but combined with the dark of the night, she might as well have been.

In the tents in Arkk’s immediate vicinity, he could hear rustling. Stirring. Whether it was the man’s words or his body hitting the ground, Arkk doubted they would have long before the entire camp was on high alert.

“Hurry,” he hissed, taking off in a run toward the large tent. Far less concerned with stealth and far more concerned with speed, he dug the metal rod into the ground and continued running, marking a trail behind him. Dakka, wearing armor, was much louder than he was. It wouldn’t matter much in a few moments.

Reaching a safe distance, Arkk quickly swept the metal rod around in a hasty circle. He inscribed symbols into the dirt out in the open, not far from the same wall he had climbed over to enter the compound. Already, shouts of alarm were going up in the distance. Torchlight started flickering against the edges of the tent canopies.

Finishing the last sigil, Arkk flung the metal rod aside and stepped into the circle. Taking a deep breath, he flooded his magic into the ring.

A bright violet light lit up around his feet, infusing all the markings he had just drawn before darting off along the line he had dragged in the direction of the armory tent. He couldn’t see it but he knew it was doing the same thing there. The light would spread through the large circle before it darted off to the three other circles he had drawn. And then…

The ground shook and a brilliant red-yellow column of twisting fire erupted in the center of the camp. A rush of wind followed the light, blowing tents over as it passed. Even Arkk, expecting this result, found himself knocked backward. He hit Dakka’s breastplate, letting out a grunt of mild pain. The orc, larger and sturdier, did not stumble or stagger. She simply clamped a hand on his shoulder, steadying him as he had done for her at the wall.

“Beautiful,” Agnete whispered, her eyes wide as she stared at the tornado of fire.

Arkk shot her a look before shaking his head. “Let’s meet up with—*Electro Deus*!” A bolt of lightning slammed into a man who had climbed out from under one of the toppled tents nearby. “Let’s get to Rekk’ar.”

“I… am allowed to purify anyone who gets in our way, am I not?” Agnete asked in a wispy cadence. She reached a hand toward the tornado, siphoning off a thin stream of fire, twisting it in the wrong direction of the spinning column of flames. It wrapped around her hands and arms, burning away her long cloak’s sleeves.

Arkk, nervously wondering if he should have used a different spell to take out the armory, slowly slipped a hand into his pocket. The icy touch of the marble brought some reassurance that he would be able to handle the situation if the purifier went berserk. “Just don’t harm our own or the slaves.”

“I… often lose control in the presence of intense fire… but…” It took obvious effort to tear her eyes from the flames in her hands. Those glowing embers slid into place, locking onto Arkk’s bright red eyes. “Something is different this time.”

She flicked her wrist, sending a stream of flames in a lazy arc at a screaming man wielding a spiked cudgel. His screams turned from anger to pain. The fires gained a bluish hue and the heat intensified. The man crumbled as he burned, cries cutting off abruptly.

Arkk grimaced at the likely painful death. Even Dakka shifted in obvious discomfort. Agnete simply flicked her wide eyes over to the body before flicking them back to Arkk.

“I shall endeavor to keep control.”

Resisting the urge to lick his heat-dried lips, Arkk nodded his head. “See that you do.”

“And I thought the gorgon were unnerving,” Dakka muttered barely loud enough for Arkk to hear. “You ever think about blinking once in a while?”

Arkk nudged the orc with his elbow. He hit hard armor but Dakka would still have felt it. Agnete didn’t seem to have heard anyway. Or, if she had, she wasn’t paying the quip any mind. Her eyes were scanning the collapsed tents, looking for any other threats. Any others for her purifying flames.

Taking a breath, Arkk nodded his head. “Let’s move.”

## 59 - Freedom


When Arkk witnessed the destruction left behind by the fire tornado, he thought it might have been a bit much. A little overkill. The ground around where the main tent had been was a smooth, glassy surface sprinkled with globs of metal that might have once been weapons. There was effectively nothing left of it.

The three smaller circles didn’t have quite the same level of destruction. They should have been smaller fire tornados but the area where the circles had been looked more like they had exploded than burned. The thought of having screwed up the ritual circles made him grimace a bit. He thought he was getting better but *something* hadn’t gone as intended despite the effectiveness of the destruction wrought.

Crouching down beside the body of Kazz’ak, Arkk found himself wondering if the fire tornado hadn’t been *enough*. He could have gone with different methods. Originally, especially after spying the higher-quality weapons, he had thought to simply ward off the area with protective spells to save them for either use or sale later on. In the end, he decided to go large and flashy with a tornado of flames for the sole purpose of intimidation. An awe-inspiring, overwhelming force designed to shock as many of the slavers into submission as possible, preferably before they realized that there were only twenty orcs present.

In fairness, it had mostly worked. The other orcs were currently clamping the slavers’ own manacles around the wrists of the sixty or so who had surrendered plus some who hadn’t surrendered but had been too wounded to continue the fight. Arkk took a bit of vindictive pleasure in knowing that their tools were being used against them. Still, Kazz’ak’s body marred that satisfaction.

Kazz’ak wasn’t the only casualty but he was the only fatality. The Flesh Weaving spell had helped get most of the others if not *better* then *intact*. It couldn’t do anything for a dead man.

“It’s his own damned fault.” Rekk’ar spat—not on the body, just off to the side. The anger in his voice, for once, wasn’t directed toward Arkk. “Ran off, treating this like a raid against farmers, not against other raiders.”

“I’m sorry,” Arkk said. “I…”

“Bah. He was always causing trouble. I warned him that his trouble would catch up to him. Idiot.”

Despite Rekk’ar firmly laying the blame at Kazz’ak’s feet, Arkk couldn’t shake the sensation of guilt in the pit of his stomach. Even if it wasn’t his fault, Arkk still felt that he could have done something. Found him faster to heal him before he died of his wounds, supported him before he wound up injured, or just instilled better discipline in the orcs to keep him from having run off in the first place. It was compounded by the fact that, through his link with his employees, Arkk knew where they were at all times and could even tell if they were in trouble. In the heat of combat with the slavers, practically everyone had been in trouble, wounded, or otherwise in need at *some* point.

He had simply failed to notice that one person needed assistance more than anyone else.

It was true that Kazz’ak had caused more than his fair share of trouble. Arkk would have twenty names on his list of favorite orcs before Kazz’ak. Yet, the orc was still one of *theirs*. Part of Fortress Al-Mir. Losing him…

Arkk clenched his fist, trying not to let his anger show lest Rekk’ar think it was directed at him. He took a breath. “Are there customs that should be observed?” he asked, soft tone feeling forced. It was probably something he should have asked following the barrows incident—there had been a number of dead orcs then as well—but those had been enemies and raiders. Kazz’ak was *theirs* and deserved better than to be left behind in some forgotten tomb.

The anger in Rekk’ar’s features slowly waned as a thoughtful expression moved to fill the vacancy. “Kazz’ak has no children. His mother is not among our group and I wouldn’t know where to begin searching for her. It would be best to bury or burn his body with his weapon over his chest.”

“Mother? She would take his belongings after his children?”

“We honor our mothers,” Rekk’ar said. “My mother was named Jarra. In honor of the one who carried me, I carry a portion of her name on mine.”

“The ‘ar?” Arkk asked, receiving a nod in return. “Dakka, Orjja, and the other women don’t follow that.”

“Women are expected to carry children of their own. They don’t need to carry their parents as well.” Rekk’ar shrugged. “It’s all nonsense. Even I think so. But it is tradition and most orcs—at least those raised among orcs—will follow it.”

“I see. What about your father?”

“Men are independent. Expected to have their own things and not need the charity of others. Women aren’t helpless by any means but they do lose time carrying us. If a child dies, that time is returned in the form of their gear, property, or other valuables.” Rekk’ar paused, lips twitching into a frown as a thought occurred to him. “Of course, we’re raiders, now mercenaries. There is a little less respect among us. I would say looting the body is a custom as well.”

“No,” Arkk said, voice firm looking back down to Kazz’ak. “We’re not so destitute that we need to salvage from our dead.”

Rekk’ar gave Arkk a curt nod of his head. “I’ll have some of the others wrap him in one of these tent tarps.”

“We’ll bury him outside Moonshine Burg. I’d suggest the fortress but we’re trying to keep our above-ground presence minimal. Not to mention the possibility of accidentally digging into a grave…”

“Unpleasant.”

“And disrespectful,” Arkk said, turning away from Kazz’ak’s body. He looked out over the utterly ruined encampment in the morning light.

None of the tents were still standing. Most had been knocked down as a result of the spell he had cast. In the time since, the orcs had gone around, piling up the tents off to the corner of the compound to make sure no stragglers were hiding underneath. Bodies littered the ground, sporting a variety of wounds. Some arrow, some blade, others had been electrocuted or burned—either by Agnete or the tornado.

The eighty-one survivors, currently kneeling with their faces pressed to one of the walls, weren’t entirely unharmed. Arkk had been a whole lot less interested in healing their wounds compared to those of his employees. He had only fixed the most life-threatening wounds. Particularly those inflicted by Lyssa. The werecat, as far as he could tell, hadn’t killed anyone. She had *mauled* them, ripping their faces and skin to shreds or lashing them with the chains still around her wrist before moving on to her next targets.

There were a few crumbled stone statues scattered around as well. Even a few up near the wall where the others kneeled. There had been a brief moment when those who surrendered realized that there weren’t that many individuals among Company Al-Mir. Some had tried to get the rest to rise against them. A hundred against twenty.

Seeing those instigators turned to stone and then shattered with a light shove stalled most thoughts of overthrowing them. Doubly so now that most of the slavers were in shackles and the rest soon would be.

Looking away from the slavers, Arkk turned his attention to those enslaved. Ilya, Dakka, Agnete, and Lexa were slowly freeing those who had been captive inside the larger buildings. There were beastmen, humans, and demihumans alike. Beaten down, weakened, and even completely starved in some cases. Olatt’an was distributing some of the food stores here.

Arkk eyed a few of the elves, wondering if they knew anything about the mythical Hallow Hill that Nyala had mentioned. The young elf didn’t know anything about it—or wasn’t willing to divulge what information she did have. She wouldn’t even tell him what kind of trees grew around the place. There was some kind of law about not discussing the place with outsiders.

Would one of the elves here know of it? Would they tell him about it?

He made a note to ask. Not now. It could wait. It could wait a long while, even. Let them get back on their feet, rest, eat, and recover.

Arkk wasn’t sure what to do with all the people. There were a lot. Both slavers and slaves. The slavers would go back to Moonshine Burg. The local garrison could deal with them there. He figured that most would be put to death. Less because it was the law and more because winter was settling in. Feeding an extra eighty unexpected mouths throughout winter was simply impossible, even for a larger burg. Their criminal status meant they were expendable.

The freed slaves, on the other hand, were a more complex issue. The burgs couldn’t just kill them even though they posed a similar problem. Winter food stores, especially with the Duke’s taxes, couldn’t sustain so many additional people.

Some of the slaves had been taken from roads—travelers that passed through the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of those could probably go back to their villages or homes. Others, however, suffered the same thing that happened to the elves Ilya had been looking for. The slavers took who they could and killed the rest. There wasn’t a place to return to. They had nothing. No belongings, no family, no home.

Arkk hadn’t thought about it before launching this raid. It wasn’t until he started thinking about how the slavers would be handled that he figured the same problem applied to the slaves as well.

He would have to wait and see what Moonshine Burg’s garrison had to say on the matter. Maybe they would try to split them up, scatter them to every village in the area. Having grown up in a small village, Arkk well knew that even a handful of unexpected mouths to feed could put an awful strain on the stores. It was entirely likely for the locals to find themselves less compassionate and more resentful of being saddled with others. Even in his most recent visit to Langleey, they had commented on a lack of food and they actually had *less* mouths to feed than normal.

There was a solution. A simple one, in fact.

Fortress Al-Mir’s food production could be expanded easily. It would take an expenditure of gold but even with the construction of the temple and the renovations he was going to have to make to it because of Savren and Zullie’s redesign, the gold required for food production was almost insignificant. He was already digging out space to better control the area around the Cursed Forest. Some of that space could be used for them. Even if they didn’t *join* Fortress Al-Mir, thus locking them out of the living space magic, they would at least have a warm place to live with a roof over their heads.

Was it ideal? Not really. They would all head back to Moonshine first. Anyone who could be offloaded back to their original villages would be. After seeing who and how many were left, Arkk could make a more informed decision.

In the meantime, he had to transport everyone back to the burg. There were far too many to efficiently use teleportation circles and he didn’t want outsiders to know of them anyway. Turning again, Arkk allowed a small smile as he spotted the tall stacks of cages on the massive carts. If they could get those rhinos back, transportation would be much easier. Maybe not pleasant, especially for the slavers, but that was more than they deserved.

“Lexa,” Arkk called out, drawing the attention of the short gremlin.

After patting a younger elf on the back, she bounded over, leaving the former slave to Ilya. “Something you needed, boss?”

“Take one of the horses. Head back to Porcupine Hill.”

Lexa drew back. “You’re firing me?”

Arkk shook his head. “Not unless you want to go. No. Rather, I’d like you to tell Katja that we’ve succeeded. In addition, I would like to meet with Katja.”

“To take her head? I got ya. Shame but—”

“No,” Arkk said, stopping her before she could continue. “I checked at the burg. There aren’t any bounties on her head. Or any mention of Porcupine Hill, for that matter.”

Which was a bit suspicious, in Arkk’s opinion. Katja, according to Edvin, was a powerful figure in the area. Enough so that the Duke’s men left her alone. Still, Arkk would have figured that there would at least be a notice of Kat’s Bandits for mercenary groups, even if it was only a formality. Edvin’s former group had a fairly sizable bounty prior to Arkk collecting it.

What had Baron Doble said? He made some deals with the local bandits to keep their activities at a reasonable level.

“I suppose that makes sense,” Lexa said with a shrug. “Hardly raid anything these days. Just take in tribute from the other groups around. The times we do raid… well, it’s just business.”

“Business. Raiding people?”

“Oh certainly. Maybe it is business our customers aren’t too happy to receive but we try our best anyway,” she said, grinning with her sharp teeth. Looking at the expression on Arkk’s face, her grin slipped. “Don’t know what nonsense Edvin has been filling your ears with. I know Marv was an utter bastard who didn’t leave many survivors but Kat always said that kind of thing was bad for business. Best leave travelers alive so that they’ll travel again, thus bringing more business to our territory. Sure, we might slit a few throats—who doesn’t?—especially of those who fight to the death.” Leaning forward, Lexa put the back of her hand to the side of her mouth in a conspiratorial whisper. “Then again, Coin-Bags who order their guards to fight to the last usually get stabbed by their own men before we can even get close. They hand over their goods and we let them go in exchange.”

“Uh-huh.”

“Just saying…” Lexa said with a shrug. “If you’re ever interested in making some extra coin on a slow mercenary day, I know all the tips and tactics.”

Arkk…  honestly didn’t know what to say to the gremlin. Or rather, he did. “No, Lexa.” It was just that he was flabbergasted that she would come out and say all that. Here they were, sending off slavers to the garrisons and she was suggesting they engage in a little highway robbery?

He could only shake his head at that.

“Suit yourself,” Lexa said, starting to turn away. She paused and turned back. “Wait, what was I supposed to do again?”

“You didn’t let me finish. This is related to the matter you overheard. I’d like to purchase the services of some spellcasters.”

Lexa put on a pout. “More than me?”

“A couple.”

“Kat isn’t going to be happy about losing me, let alone other spellcasters.”

“First, I don’t want to *hire* a bunch more bandits. This is a temporary affair. Loan us some spellcasters for a few days, help with the ritual, and then head back with a sack of money. And… maybe don’t tell her that she lost you,” Arkk said with a small frown. “At least not while surrounded inside Porcupine Hill.”

“Nothing is hotter than a man who cares,” Lexa said, making doe-eyes up at him.

Arkk just rolled his eyes. “I’m sure some of the others would be more receptive to your advances.”

“Ah, but sleeping with the boss usually comes with advantages that the rank and file lack, even if they aren’t *lacking*,” she said with a wink.

“I… don’t think you’re supposed to say that part.”

“What can I say? I’m an honest thief.”

“Uh… huh. Right. Do you think Katja will agree?”

Shrugging off a flicker of a pout, Lexa said, “No idea. Don’t think anyone has offered this kind of arrangement before. No harm in asking, right?”

“That’s what I’m hoping for.”

***

Processing the prisoners and the freed slaves was taking a lot longer than even Arkk had expected.

After confirming the veracity of his claims, the Moonshine Burg garrison had delivered a modest bounty to the stayover. It wasn’t much, at least not compared to the coffers of Fortress Al-Mir, but it was substantial enough to make his crew happy after dividing it up among them. They had spent the last five days partying, tossing it all away on food, drink, intimate company, weapons, even some furniture that they wanted to take back home. As long as they weren’t getting into trouble, Arkk was happy to let them run amok.

The gorgon and Agnete, less interested in partying, had already gone back. The former had been away from their heated rocks for too long while the latter simply said that she had matters to think on.

Arkk probably could have returned as well, leaving Ilya in charge of what needed to be done in this burg. However, upon returning with the captives and freed slaves, he had pulled those in charge of the garrison aside and let them know that he could provide lodging through the winter for anyone who didn’t have anywhere else to return to. As the leader of Company Al-Mir, he felt it was important to be seen and noted as an active participant in providing aid. The last thing he wanted was to take everyone back to the fortress only for them to feel like they were being kept prisoner once again in some underground dungeon.

As for the slavers…

A hooded man on the wooden platform down below pulled a lever. Five trapdoors opened as one and Edvin started making choking sounds. The man rubbed at his throat, squirming as he stood next to Arkk, watching the display in the courtyard below with undisguised disquiet.

“I think… I should rethink my opinions on beheading,” Edvin said. “A nice clean chop to the throat sounds a lot nicer—and quicker—than *that*. That guy’s neck didn’t even break. Look at him kicking and squirming… I think I’m going to be sick.”

Arkk… didn’t necessarily disagree. He wasn’t very happy to watch either. The only reason he was here at all was that he felt some responsibility for having been the one to bring them here. He had known that this was coming, even before they had been loaded up on their prison carts. He didn’t *disagree* with the actions being carried out down on the gallows. That didn’t make it easier to watch.

“Weren’t you in a murderous band of highwaymen?” Arkk asked, mostly as a distraction. He had brought Edvin here specifically to clear his name. If at all possible, Arkk didn’t want more people with wanted posters in his employ. The goodwill they had garnered here was enough to get the burg to rescind the bounty on Edvin’s head.

Given that the man *hadn’t* run off in the middle of the fight, Arkk figured it was an adequate reward. If only he could do the same for Rekk’ar and Olatt’an. Unfortunately, they were wanted by practically the entire Duchy, not just one burg out on the outskirts.

“Well, yes. I wasn’t a *highwayman* though. Just the man who could get things that other people couldn’t. We didn’t use nooses either. As my mother always said, these burgs are so uncivilized.”

“It could be worse,” a new voice cut in.

Arkk stiffened, looking to the balcony door. A woman strode across the platform, wearing a slim black and red outfit. She had a sword affixed to either hip and a long red cloak draped over her shoulders like a cape. Her face wasn’t immediately familiar to Arkk. The black, animalistic stripe tattoos on the dark skin of her bare arms and face clued him into her identity.

Katja. The Bandit Lord of Porcupine Hill.

While she was only slightly shorter than Arkk, the hulking man at her side made her look even smaller. He had graying hair and a withered look to his face but more muscles than half the orcs in Arkk’s employ. Muscles he showed off with a lack of a shirt.

Arkk almost missed Lexa at Katja’s other side, the short gremlin gave him a waist-high wave of her hand and a nervous grin.

“If I had my way, the wurms would be chasing you across the desert,” Katja continued, ignorant or ignoring of the look Arkk was giving her. What *was* a bandit lord doing walking around so openly in the middle of a burg?

“Ah… well…” Edvin shifted where he stood.

“I see you failed to take my advice,” Katja said, turning her amber eyes onto Arkk.

Arkk had to resist the urge to rub the back of his neck. His suit, a black coat not too dissimilar to that which the inquisitors wore, was the nicest thing he had. Yet he still couldn’t shake Hawkwood’s words about him not quite fitting in. Facing someone so well dressed—and so full of confidence in waltzing right into a garrison—had him feeling inadequate once again.

“Technically,” Arkk said, drawing in a breath to buy a moment to calm himself down, “Edvin fulfilled his end of our agreement. I can’t just toss him into a pit for no reason.”

“I’m sure he will give adequate cause before long.” Her eyes flicked over the balcony, looking down on the garrison courtyard with a cool expression on her face. “Those are the slavers?”

“We captured just under half of what was at the outpost. Those five represent the first of those the garrison has decided to execute for their crimes.”

“Half,” Katja said, glancing down to Lexa for a brief moment. “There were two hundred according to reports. The rest escaped?”

“Dead. Died in combat.”

“Casualties on your end?”

“Just one.”

Katja’s eyebrows slowly crept up her forehead. That impressed her. Though she didn’t give away much in her expression, there was a slight tension. Nervous? “I see,” she said. A single blink and all signs of nervousness vanished. “I underestimated you. I expected a fight, deaths, and hopefully some damage to their outpost. Enough for my men to slip in and finish the job.”

“Company Al-Mir is good at what it does.”

“Indeed. And now Company Al-Mir wishes to make deals with bandits?”

Arkk took a moment to look around. He and Edvin hadn’t been the only ones up on this balcony. The baron of Moonshine Burg stood apart, leaning over the balcony’s railing next to the captain of this garrison. Several guards were stationed around as well. None offered significant reaction to Katja’s initial approach and none reacted now that she had mentioned her… profession.

Company Al-Mir being able to take on the slavers made her uncomfortable. Her brazen appearance in the middle of a large burg had *him* nervous in turn. He had expected Lexa to come back with a date and a time to meet at Porcupine Hill. Not *this*.

“I understand you have spellcasters in your employ,” Arkk said, not bothering to drop his volume. Trying to do so wouldn’t help if they put any effort into listening in and it would only make him look more suspicious. “I’m working on a contract that will require a few more than I have in my employ.”

“I loaned you Lexa because your aims served my goal. This does not.”

“I am prepared to compensate them for their time.”

“Compensate *me* for their time, you mean.”

Arkk pressed his lips together before nodding his head. “Of course.”

Katja flashed her pearly white teeth. “Then we can discuss business.”

***

The Baron of Moonshine Burg gave Arkk a small smile as he poured amber liquid into a pair of short glasses. He slid one through a narrow canyon made from stacks of papers on his desk, leaving it in front of Arkk. The other, he picked up and downed in its entirety before Arkk even had a chance to reach for his.

“I like when things are peaceful,” the Baron said, immediately pouring himself another drink.

Baron Doble. So far, they hadn’t interacted much besides Arkk’s initial meeting with the man. Arkk had dealt with the head of the garrison for all bounty-related topics. Now, he had been asked to join the Baron for a quick discussion.

Arkk wasn’t quite sure where this discussion was going. To be polite, he picked up the offered glass and took a small sip. It burned a bit with that same smokey taste. Not an easy drink to down at all. “Peace is nice,” he hedged.

Doble didn’t drink his fresh glass, holding it at the level of his chest instead. “But?”

“No buts. I would prefer it if things were peaceful. Company Al-Mir tries to do its part to keep the peace where we operate.”

The Baron let out a tittering laugh, filled with sarcasm. “A mercenary preferring peace?” he said with another laugh. “I know your type. You feed off the troubles of others. If the world were peaceful, you wouldn’t exist.”

“I doubt the world *can* be peaceful as long as people exist,” Arkk said with a sorry frown. “Someone is always going to hate someone.”

With the slavers done for, he was planning on heading back to Fortress Al-Mir to figure out what needed to be done with the ritual and maybe see if he could figure out any other high-profile jobs that would draw the eye of the inquisitors. Preferably jobs far, far away from Moonshine Burg, Kajta, and the Pious of the Golden Order. Then there was Hawkwood’s invitation to consider.

“If anything, I hope we’ve made your corner of the Duchy a little more peaceful,” Arkk said instead of arguing, eyes roaming over the man’s desk. What were all those papers for anyway? It looked like a lot of reports from forward scouts. Moonshine Burg was right on the border with the Evestani Sultanate. He had mentioned troubles last time but Arkk hadn’t paid too much attention.

Having felt the stares of those from the Golden Order, Arkk was a *little* more concerned.

“I suppose I should thank you for that,” Doble admitted, grudgingly. “The larger burgs up north couldn’t handle them. Then they moved down here. They weren’t playing nice.”

“Like Katja plays nice?” Arkk asked, lifting his eyes from one stack of papers. He was curious about why the bandit was allowed to wander around so freely.

Doble let out a withering sigh. “I don’t know how they did it wherever you crawled out from,” he said before pausing to take in about half his drink. “Here, we have more concerns than just local matters. The ‘Stani’s like to poke us now and again. Plant their flags on our rightful territory until they get pushed back. We’ve too much to deal with keeping them away from the villages under our domain to worry about more *internal* matters. My deal with Katja keeps things peaceful.”

“Highwaymen and marauders are peaceful?”

“She is supposed to keep the various bandit tribes in line.”

“Like Marv’s group of bandits.”

The Baron nodded his head, frowning. “It isn’t a perfect system. That issue was one Katja and I were planning on dealing with. She was certain they were testing waters, trying to decide if it was possible to usurp her leadership. You simply provided a more immediate solution.”

“I see…”

“Rest assured, it isn’t a deal that I enjoyed making,” the Baron said, pouring a third glass of alcohol. “As long as they aren’t causing too much trouble, we look the other way. We have to look the other way despite this deal, so it is advantageous towards us.”

Arkk hummed, looking down again. As his eyes roamed over another stack of papers, a wax seal caught his eye. Although broken open so that the Baron could read the letter within, the striped heraldry of the Duke stood out. Part of the letter was sticking out from the stack it was in as well. He couldn’t read the entire thing with it half shoved into the stack. What he could read made his eyes widen.

*Duke Levi Woldair cordially invites Baron Sten Doble to—*
*Contained within, you will find four inv—*
*Wishes you good travels and—*

Arkk’s eyes snapped up. The Baron, between glasses again, had said something. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what. Instead, he frowned and made a show of approaching the window. “Is the Evestani Sultanate really that aggressive that you have to constantly worry?”

“They poke and they prod. Testing the men on the front lines. No real skirmishes break out but there is a tension that no one denies,” the Baron answered, thankfully moving on from whatever he had said while Arkk was distracted. “Last few years haven’t been so bad. I gather the Duke had been making headways toward peace. *Proper* peace. Still, the old guard that got pushed back in the last war are bitter about being fended off. Wouldn’t surprise me to find a legion gone rogue if they spotted a weakness. It got particularly bad about three months ago. I’m hoping the winter cools them off. Don’t get much snow out here but it does get cold enough for an army to lose their toes to frostbite.”

Arkk let out a small shiver. While the ambient temperature had dropped over the last few weeks, the shiver came from memories of the few cases of frostbite he had seen around the village in years past. Fingers or toes completely blackened to the point where they had sometimes cracked and fallen off. Old Pucy’s entire hand had been lost after falling drunk out in the cold. His nose, ears, and feet hadn’t been any better. Then, in barely a week, his arm had swelled with rotten flesh. He hadn’t survived.

“Well,” Arkk said. “If your… *deal* works for you, I don’t particularly care. There isn’t a bounty on Katja’s head. None of my business.”

“Of course not,” the Baron said with a mild glower. Did he want someone to take out Katja? Arkk honestly couldn’t tell.

“Company Al-Mir will be departing someday soon and we don’t currently have plans to return. However, if you do have more trouble with slavers, feel free to send a missive. Not sure where we’ll be heading but I can bet that Hawkwood of White Company in Cliff will be keeping an ear out.”

“You’re leaving?”

“Nothing else keeping us here. Unless you had another job that pays well enough to occupy our time?”

“No. No. I just…” The Baron let out a sigh, setting his glass on the desk. Arkk’s eyes flicked to the Duke’s letter before snapping back to Doble. “That is a relief.”

“Was our presence so terrible?”

“When you so handily exterminated that first group, I admit to growing concerned. I’ve heard of mercenary groups that will effectively oust burg leadership in favor of themselves. With you making deals with Katja, I grew concerned that you and she were plotting something.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, shooting a glance down at his glass. For a moment, he worried that the Baron had decided to poison him in his paranoia. Arkk dismissed the notion. The Baron had been drinking from the same source and there had been nothing in the glass beforehand. Even still, Arkk felt that the one small sip he had taken was more than enough. He set the glass down.

“I meant what I said to her earlier. I need spellcasters and she can provide.”

“Could have been code,” Baron Doble said, taking a seat. “I hardly believe even a foolish bandit would plot against me within earshot. I was worried I’d have to make deals…” Shaking his head, he looked up to Arkk. “Never mind. So long as Company Al-Mir clears out within the week, we’ll have no problems between us.”

“I’ll have my employees packing before nightfall.”

The Baron nodded his head before motioning toward the door. Arkk watched a moment as the man picked up a paper from one of the stacks.

Leaving the man and his potential poison, Arkk hurried out of the room. He made his way out of the keep, avoiding any further discussions with anyone. At least until he reached the main gate. There, he found someone leaning against the wall, waiting for him.

Lexa flashed him a sharp-toothed grin. “He hand over a big sack of coin?”

“The garrison already paid us,” Arkk said, looking down at the gremlin.

Her smile vanished. “Thought you were bullying concessions. Kat always said he was a pushover.”

“Don’t speak so loud right in front of the keep,” Arkk said, shooting a look at the gate guards. Placing a firm hand on Lexa’s shoulder, he led her a short distance away. She quickly brushed him off.

“I’m not a child.”

“You’re a thief. I like you in my sight.”

“I’m *your* thief. Remember? I wouldn’t steal from my employer.”

Arkk doubted her words completely. Still, he smiled and said, “True. As long as my coin is good, right? Speaking of, how would you like to earn another bonus for a task suited toward your skills?”

Lexa’s eyes positively gleamed as she stood a little straighter. “Something out there you can’t buy with your pockets of gold?”

“Just a letter I’d like to read, actually,” Arkk said, looking back to the Moonshine Burg keep. “Let’s find somewhere a little more private and I’ll tell you what I need you to do…”

## 60 - Slaver Aftermath


Nyala peered around the edge of one of the many doors within Fortress Al-Mir. Something big was going on. Something she didn’t want to miss. The two months she had spent with that miserable Master taught her a few things. Maybe things more important than anything she had learned while still at Hallow Hill.

Knowing what was going on was important. Vitally so. Being able to anticipate the Master’s mood and plans for the day let her adjust herself to be exactly what he had wanted to see. Knowing saved her from several beatings that others hadn’t been so lucky to avoid. Not all of them, unfortunately, but enough that she had managed to get away with bruises whereas the others came away with scars or clipped ears.

Fortress Al-Mir was different. She knew that now. Ever since that outing a few weeks ago when she had stolen the knife from the market. Somehow, even with his back turned, *he* knew the instant she laid her fingers on the blade. She had thought she was going to die then and there. There would have been nothing she could have done about it. Yet, instead, he had given her *his* dagger just so that he could return the knife she stole to its proper owner.

He even said that she could leave if she wanted. Go home to Hallow Hill.

She *couldn’t* go back. Hallow Hill was a secret. Those who left weren’t allowed back. Even though she hadn’t wanted to leave, she figured she wouldn’t be welcome leading people back to the Hill. Not that she could if she wanted to. She didn’t know where it was. The people who had taken her away had thrown her into a cage with a sack over her head, dragging her away. She couldn’t even retrace her steps.

Until she figured out what she was supposed to do—what she was *going* to do—Nyala didn’t have anywhere else to go. That didn’t mean she was going to sit around in her room like a child. *Knowing* was important even if the people here weren’t going to beat her. Especially when something so big was happening.

There were people here now. Many people. At least a hundred, though with them moving around in the large room, Nyala wasn’t able to count exactly. Most looked young. As young as she was, if not younger. There wasn’t a single person in the room who looked *too* old. Not even middle-aged.

Beyond their ages, Nyala couldn’t help but notice the state the newcomers were in. Everyone looked half-starved and quite a few sported fading marks, minor scars, and missing bits of hair. Not that odd, all things considered. Travel was dangerous and hard work could leave bruises on the careless. Yet there was one thing that Nyala’s sharp eyes picked out above all else.

Without exception, every one of the newcomers had thick rings of black and blue bruises around their wrists.

*That* was familiar. With one hand clenching tight to the sheath of *her* dagger, Nyala’s other hand rubbed her wrists, feeling the phantom pain of heavy shackles weighing her down.

Narrowing her eyes, Nyala focused on the faces, trying to discern why there were slaves here and whether or not she should finally try to flee. She hadn’t been able to find any exits during her stealthy explorations of this place but there were plenty of doors that wouldn’t open for her. However, looking over the crowd, she started to feel the tension in the back of her neck relax.

She knew what expressions slaves wore. The downtrodden, hopelessness of being taken from a village that had either been destroyed or that they would never see again. She had seen it herself on more faces than she could count. Probably her own face as well.

Instead, among this group within Fortress Al-Mir, there was an undercurrent of hope. It wasn’t exactly joy. Plenty, especially the youngest among the group, still looked frightened as they watched with weary eyes. They weren’t slaves. At least not anymore.

They were like her.

Which was something that might have been more obvious if she looked at their actions rather than their appearance.

The more familiar orcs were moving about the room along with that monster that made Nyala shudder every time their gazes met—a disturbingly common occurrence given she had eyes *everywhere* on her body. They moved through the room, setting up large tents spread about. It was a bit strange to put tents indoors. She didn’t know why they didn’t just build rooms. She had seen those smaller monsters digging this place out over the past week, using some kind of magic to make tiles and brick walls that would have sparked envy in any builder back at Hallow Hill.

The older newcomers were helping the orcs and that monster, putting up tents themselves as well as bringing in low cots for sleeping, chairs, and even some tools like the kind a carpenter would use. Maybe they were planning on building more permanent dwellings.

“What are you doing out here?”

Nyala *yelped*, jolting as she whirled around. It wasn’t easy to sneak up on an elf, not with their hearing, yet she must have let herself get too distracted with the newcomers. Spinning around, clutching her blade tight with one hand on the hilt and the other on the sheath, she found herself faced with someone her height. At first, she thought it was a human child. Elves typically grew at a much slower rate compared to humans until their middle-late teenage years, at which point they would have a sharp growth spurt and put on several heads of height over a year. Nyala had yet to hit that spurt so someone her height could be even a few years younger than she was.

She quickly noticed a few things wrong with that assumption. This person had pointed ears, though not long like an elf. She had a round head with thin, slightly wavy pupils. Her bright red hair defied gravity as it stuck up, making her look taller than she actually was.

“You’re a gremlin.”

The gremlin smiled, showing off sharp teeth. “How come you’re not with the others?”

“Others?” Nyala blinked, stiffening as she realized she was standing fully within the doorway. More than a few of the newcomers were looking in her direction. Crushing her lips into a thin line, Nyala turned away and started walking in the opposite direction from the gremlin.

“Hey, wait! I don’t think you’re supposed to be walking around on your own.”

“I’m fine,” Nyala snapped back, breaking into a hurried jog.

“Arkk said he wanted you all together until he had a chance to speak with everyone. I don’t think you’re supposed to be walking around with this knife either. It’s dangerous, you know?”

Nyala blinked. *This* knife? Glancing down to her hands, she lurched to a stop when she realized both were empty. Spinning around, she glared at the gremlin. The demihuman stopped a few paces back, holding the dagger in one hand as she examined the blade.

“Not the best blade I’ve seen. The edge is a bit dull and the tip is chipped. It has seen some use. I would guess mostly at cutting thick hide but there are a few notches here that look more like damage from metal against metal. A hunting dagger used in combat? That’s my guess.”

“Give it back.”

The gremlin snapped the blade back into the sheath. Looking at Nyala for a moment, she grabbed the edge of her long jacket. It was a brown leather thing that looked worn beyond reasonable use. From the waist down, it was less a jacket and more long ribbons of leather that hung down just below the gremlin’s knees. However, that wasn’t an intentional design choice. The ribbons looked torn and ripped, likely over a great deal of time. Pinched between her fingers, the gremlin pulled open her jacket.

Nyala’s eyes boggled at the display underneath. She wore a matching leather corset that wrapped around her middle. On it, a dozen needle-sized shafts of sharp metal lined her corset, making her into a facsimile of a metal skeleton. A long bandolier hung from shoulder to hip, covered with thicker blades. The entirety of the inside of her jacket looked made up of nothing but knives arranged back and forth in rows.

“I think I’ll keep hold of it until I have a chance to talk to Arkk,” she said, moving to slip the dagger somewhere among the mess of other blades. “Why don’t you come back—”

Nyala lunged at the gremlin. That was *her* dagger. Arkk had given it to *her* so that she could defend herself. It rankled how easily it had been taken from her but she wasn’t about to sit around and let the gremlin keep it. He promised her lessons. She would never get those lessons if he thought she was so useless that she couldn’t even keep hold of his gift.

The lunge caught the gremlin off guard. They both went to the floor, Nyala on top with the gremlin twisting underneath. She grasped at the dagger, fully prepared to wrench it out of the gremlin’s grip, only for the gremlin to let go with hardly a fight. Nyala didn’t let her surprise get the best of her. Springing off the floor, she backed away, not taking her eyes off the gremlin.

“I’m all for a roll-around as much as the next woman but you’ve got to give me some warning,” she said, straightening her jacket and corset as she got to her feet. “You almost skewered yourself. And not on anything *fun*.”

Nyala didn’t say anything back to the gremlin. She took a step back, drawing the dagger and pointing its tip toward her enemy. Only to get the gremlin rolling her eyes.

“You’re holding it all wrong.” The gremlin produced a blade from *somewhere* inside her jacket. She spun it around her finger twice before gripping the hilt. The way she grabbed it was backward. If her arm were out with her thumb up, the blade would be pointed at the ground. “Like this,” she said, taking a step forward.

Nyala took a step back. She didn’t turn and flee from the much more experienced gremlin. The gremlin could probably have flung one of those daggers right at her if she wanted to hurt her. More importantly, Nyala’s sharp ears picked up on a set of familiar footsteps approaching from the large room with all the newcomers.

“Someone your size needs all the power you can scrape together,” the gremlin continued, oblivious. “You’re more likely to pierce light armor with a heavy downward slam than any wimpy jab or slash the way you’re holding it. If you—”

“What is going on out here?”

The smile on the gremlin’s face froze. She turned around, using the movement to hide the dagger back under her jacket, and faced an irritated Ilya. “I saw this one sneaking about,” she said. “I tried to bring her back but she got a knife from somewhere and I thought she needed a few pointers.”

“Lexa… Nyala is not one of our recent arrivals,” Ilya said, lips tight. “I hope you weren’t threatening her.”

“No! Of course not. I’m a thief, not a monster,” the gremlin said, turning to Nyala with an expression that pleaded for affirmation.

At the movement, Ilya’s eyes flicked up, pointedly looking at the dagger in Nyala’s hands. “What did Arkk say when he gave that to you?”

Nyala flinched, slipping it back into its sheath. “Not to use it on anyone at the fortress.”

“Then why is it out? Was Lexa threatening you?”

That pleading expression on the gremlin boiled over into silent, panicked begging. The gremlin hadn’t threatened her… Not if she really thought that one of the newcomers was running around with a knife. She could still say so and Ilya would surely believe her story over the gremlin’s… Which the gremlin knew, judging by her expression.

“Arkk also said I could seek lessons from someone if he couldn’t find the time. I saw how many daggers she had and figured she knew how to use them, so I asked.”

“Like I said, I was just giving out a few pointers,” the gremlin said, quick to latch onto the provided excuse.

Ilya looked between them. It was the same expression Nyala had seen on her mother’s face when she had been caught fighting with her brother only for both of them to claim that nothing was happening. Nyala smothered the painful feeling in her stomach that welled up at the thought of Hallow Hill and quickly moved forward.

“Lexa promised to teach me how to fight.”

The gremlin raised an eyebrow but didn’t offer any corrections to the statement, merely shrugging and nodding her head.

With a slight shake of her head and a faint sigh, Ilya turned. “I see,” she said, not sounding too happy about the prospect. “Worry about that later. There are a lot of new people here and a lot of them are scared or uncertain. Your experiences here could help reassure them. It would also be good for you and Yavin to meet them. Why not fetch him and meet us back here? It would be good for Lexa to meet him too so that there aren’t any other *misunderstandings*.”

Lexa let out a lame chuckle, running her fingers through her red hair.

Nyala stared at her for a moment before turning away to head back to her room. She didn’t know if she would get lessons from the gremlin. She didn’t know if she *wanted* lessons from the gremlin. A part of her hoped so. Or hoped that the newcomers would need a lot of attention.

Anything that would help distract her from thoughts of her lost home.

***

“It seems… the consul have… uh… *canceled* on the day’s meeting,” the nervous attendant said, shifting awkwardly before remembering something. “Your Highness,” he quickly added.

Duke Levi Woldair didn’t outwardly show his irritation in the attendant’s mannerisms or lack of decorum. His fingers drummed against the armrest of his throne. The repetitive thumping of each finger against the near-black wood was more than enough to make the attendant flinch over and over again.

“Cancelled.”

“Yes, Your Highness.”

“It doesn’t surprise me that those barbarians have such pathetic manners.” The Duke stood from his throne and began walking back and forth in front of it, one hand tucked against his back while the other held tight to the ermine cloak draped over his shoulders. “They barge into our domain, demand an audience, and then renege? Did they offer any excuses or request an alternate meeting time?”

“I… don’t think they are interested in any further meetings.”

The Duke stopped and slowly turned his head. “You don’t *think*?"

“When the escort arrived at the consulate, they found it abandoned. Your Highness.”

“Abandoned? Was it an attack?” the Duke asked with a hint of nervousness entering his tone.

The attendant shook his head, looking like he wished it was. “No. Just deserted. From piecing together reports of those in the neighborhood… it seems as if the consul and their retinue departed Cliff in the middle of the night. About a week ago.”

The Duke froze, locking in place with an expression that would frighten a battle-hardened orc. He took a step forward, pointing at the attendant. “You—” He didn’t get any further before a lithe set of fingers gently graced his elbow. He closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath. “Get out,” the Duke said, voice soft. “Out!” he said, louder. “All of you.”

No one needed telling twice. The guards, attendants, and advisors all vanished, slipping out of the long throne room through the nearest exits. When the last door slammed shut, the Duke sank back onto his throne, cupping his eyes with the palms of his hands.

“Why? Why now? Things were going so well. The banquets, the lavish gifts… Relations with the Evestani Sultanate have never been better. I was set to marry the Sultan’s second daughter!” His fist slammed down onto his thigh. “Then the ambassadors departed. Communications turned hostile. Troops started amassing on the border, *demanding* entry. The special consul they sent in won’t even meet with me to tell me why. What changed? Was it something I did?”

Alya licked her lips, not sure what the best response would be. With her hand on his shoulder, they had been well on their way to forging a lasting peace between two nations that had been at war time and time again throughout her lifetime. Just when the end had come within sight, with the Princess and the Duke’s marriage only needing a date for the ceremony… *this* happened. “You treated them with dignity and respect. You offered a wealth of gifts… peace…” she said, trailing off, entirely at a loss of how to salvage the situation.

“And they have thrown that peace in my face,” the Duke said, thumping his head back against the high wall of the throne. “Winter is starting. They won’t march an army this time of year. Their soldiers would die of frostbitten limbs before crossing half of the Duchy.”

“Then… perhaps there is still time. We have a few months to figure out—”

“Is there a point?” the Duke snapped, angry eyes meeting her silver eyes. “They have proved themselves the barbarians we *knew* they were. Unable to carry on a meaningful dialog when *whatever* happened upset them so much.”

“The point is to avoid another war…”

“I feel we have crossed that bridge,” the Duke said, shaking his head. “We have three months of winter. Not to guess at the motivations of their childish sultan and bow down to his temperamental whims, but to *prepare*.”

“If we could just speak with Princess—”

“And how do you propose we do that?” the Duke asked, shaking his head. “She is deep within the Sultanate, likely locked up by her mad father for daring to consort with me.”

“Her father endorsed the marriage!”

“Her father is the one gathering an army on our border!” The Duke stood, flourishing his ermine cloak as he stepped away from the throne. He paused and turned his head. “We tried,” he said. “We failed. Perhaps our nation’s children will have a better chance. For now, we cannot afford to continue as we have been. We have to prepare or they will never get that chance.”

Alya leaned back against the wall where she had been standing just to the side of the Duke’s throne, watching the short man approach the main entryway with a forlorn look on her face.

“Fetch the messenger harpies,” he barked as he threw open the door. “And someone get White Company here as soon as possible.”

The strength in her legs faltered, leading to her slumping down onto the throne. She put a hand to her forehead, wondering much the same questions the Duke had asked. Why now? What happened in the last four months that threw away all their hard work and effort over the last fifteen years?

## 61 - Plans and Preparation


“It is a trap,” Rekk’ar said, lowering the invitation to the Hawkwood’s dinner down to the meeting table. “Obviously.”

“I concur,” Olatt’an said.

“The fact that your missives were delivered by a Swiftwing harpy should have been evidence enough of *that*,” Zullie said, adjusting her rectangular glasses. “They’re reserved for use by the Duke only, for correspondence with important people. The King or the Ecclesiarch. Not random mercenary leaders.”

“Forgive me, Master. I *also* find it suspicious that you fend off the inquisitors and then suddenly receive an invitation to their last known location.”

Arkk tapped his finger against the table a few times. None of them were saying anything that he hadn’t already thought.

“You aren’t seriously considering going?” Rekk’ar asked, tone somewhat resigned.

“I am. Not just for a meeting with Hawkwood—assuming this *isn’t* a trap. Right now, Company Al-Mir is not in any way sanctioned. I’m not either. I don’t know how long that will last and there are *other* reasons to visit Cliff. Doing so would be much easier as a free man.”

“What reasons?” Rekk’ar leaned forward, hand clapping flat against the table. “What could be worth stepping into the inquisitor’s net?”

“Two things. First,” Arkk paused, glancing at Vezta. “I want us to investigate the magic academy.”

Vezta tilted her head to one side, violet-hued hair dangling over her shoulder. “Master, I believe I have informed you that I am incapable of casting traditional magic.”

“Not for the magic. If you remember, I thought the academy might be another fortress. I’d like confirmation.”

“Ah. Understood.”

Arkk nodded his head. Little more needed to be said. If it was another fortress and it was possible to claim it, that would change things drastically. It would bring Cliff under his sphere of influence, allowing him free teleportation as well as a foothold that would be difficult to oust him from. Having a fortress in the center of the city of his enemies was less than ideal but the possible benefits would be great.

“Secondly,” he started, glancing at Ilya at his side. Reaching into his jacket, he withdrew a piece of fine parchment, folded over three times. Placing it down on the table, he pulled back and waited.

“What’s that?” Ilya asked.

“Invitations to the Duke’s next party. We can bring four people in.”

Ilya’s eyes went wide as she snatched up the invitation. At the same time, Rekk’ar let out a loud huff.

“Now they’re just being obvious.”

“Too obvious,” Olatt’an said with a frown. “Or… the Duke did not send you this invitation, did he?”

Arkk shook his head. “Originally, it was addressed to Baron Doble of Moonshine Burg. I… felt sorry for how much paperwork the man had and decided to lend a helping hand in reducing that work.”

“You *stole* this?” Ilya snapped, eyes narrowing as she glared up at him. “But… it has your name on it.”

“It does. Although grudgingly, Lexa pointed me in the direction of Edvin for help with that. Whatever other problems people have with him, he seems to be a competent forger.”

“Whatever other problems?” Edvin said, aghast as he spoke for the first time this meeting. “What people have problems with me?”

“Anyone who has met you?” Lexa said with a joyless smile.

“You can’t think this will actually work,” Ilya said, rubbing her temple. “Believe me, nobody wants to get into the Duke’s manor more than me. A chance to talk to my…” Shaking her head, Ilya held up the invitation. “The Duke isn’t going to let someone in who he doesn’t remember sending an invitation to just because they have one.”

“I don’t think the Duke sent these invitations out,” Arkk said, pointing out the differences between the handwriting of the Duke Levi Woldair’s signature and the rest of the letter. “Besides that, I highly doubt the Duke will be manning the door. It will be some servant. Probably *also* not the person who wrote the invitations.”

“Then what? We get in and just act like we belong?”

“Exactly! We’re not there to engage with the Duke. We’re there to speak with Alya. Get her out of there or just *hire* her so that we might get her out sometime in the future.”

Ilya’s open mouth shut with a slight clack as her eyes drifted back to the letter. She was mulling it over now. The possibility of meeting with her mother would entice her. In ten minutes, she would be arguing to go as well.

Arkk… although things had been different upon first finding Fortress Al-Mir, wasn’t sure how much he actually wanted to meet with Alya. There were just things about the situation with her that didn’t quite add up. Especially not after hearing what Ilya had to say regarding her little spying campaign on the Duke’s manor during their last visit to the city.

He was more interested in the academy. The possibility of a fortress being there was… too great to ignore. He didn’t exactly know how having a second [HEART] would work but it had to be better than just one, vulnerable, stationary [HEART]. A backup for if things went wrong. Its location left much to be desired but he already wanted to get rid of the Duke simply for his crimes against the people of the Duchy. Either it would be a good staging ground for an assault or it could be claimed afterward, after making the city safe.

Although… he had no idea how to go about getting rid of the Duke without making enemies of the entire kingdom. That bit of the plan might not be possible in the near future. Not with how much of a failure their recruitment attempts had gone in Moonshine Burg.

“Recruitment at Moonshine was a failure,” Arkk said, looking around the table. In the month and a half they spent at the burg, they had gained Edvin, Lexa, and three more orcs who, as far as Arkk could tell, thought that Company Al-Mir was an orc-run company. “We need more people.”

“You intend to do that at Cliff?” Rekk’ar asked, shaking his head. “Jump into a trap and then what? Ask the locals to get you out?”

“Not exactly.” Arkk turned back to Edvin and Lexa. “When I was there last time, I noticed a significant number of demihumans and beastmen who weren’t… exactly well off. Some could fight.” He thought back to the group that had harassed Dakka. He hadn’t personally seen them fight and her review of their capabilities hadn’t been a glowing one. Still, people could be trained. “I doubt any are all too thrilled with living in the Duke’s shadow. A new place to live with proper food and pay would be something many would consider, right?”

“Uh…” Edvin glanced to his side, frowning at Lexa before looking to his other side where Khan was wrapped around a warm rock, only half paying attention to the meeting. “Why are you looking at me?”

“Because you and Lexa are going to be my recruiters.”

“Wait. Wait a moment. Hold on. I don’t know about this. My mother always said not to get between an inquisitor and the ones they’re after. She also said never to walk into obvious traps. ‘Edvin, my little pointed sword, don’t you plant your foot in the waiting maw of a beast,’ she said. You didn’t forget that this is a trap, right? Because this is the most obvious trap I’ve ever seen and I have seen a few.”

“Don’t worry. Nobody will know that you’re working with us. You’re new. Brand new. Nobody will know you’re part of Company Al-Mir. And that is the whole point.”

“That’s only going to last until we start handing out flyers for recruiting.”

“Edvin, please,” Arkk said, moving around the table. He clapped a hand on Edvin’s shoulder, smiling. “You’re cleverer than that.”

“I am?” The man cleared his throat and then nodded to himself. “I mean. Yes. I am. But why not explain your thoughts for the orcs? They don’t look like they’ve quite caught on to your equally clever plan.”

Rekk’ar curled his lip, growling from the back of his throat.

“You aren’t going to be shouting Company Al-Mir’s praises. You’re going to be spreading rumors. ‘Oh, Lexa? Fancy meeting you here at this incredibly crowded tavern. Heard about that new free company?’”

Lexa blinked as Arkk turned to her but she quickly grinned. “‘The one with loads of gold they’re paying people with?’”

“‘That’s the one! Heard they’re recruiting. I’d apply myself but seems like they’re interested in demihumans and beastmen.’”

“‘Oh… I don’t know about that. Probably will come up with excuses not to pay us.’”

“‘Not true! Practically the entire company is made up of non-humans. Their second in command is even an elf. A beautiful elf at that with the most shapely—”

“Arkk…” Ilya said, tone flat.

“‘A gold coin per month is the going rate for recruits,’” Arkk continued ignoring Ilya. “‘And free living space and food!’”

Lexa’s eyes danced as she looked back and forth between Ilya and Arkk. Her grin showed off just a few more teeth before she managed to get a hold of herself. “‘Wow! A whole gold coin? Where do I sign up?’”

Arkk let the placid smile drop from his face as he looked down at Edvin. “Well?”

Rekk’ar snorted, drawing the attention of the table. “You should quit the mercenary business and take up a career in the arts.”

“Really?” Edvin said with a serious frown. “I was going to say not to quit his day job. Mind if I… adjust some of that dialog?”

“Have at it,” Arkk said, releasing the man’s shoulder as he continued to make his way around the meeting table. “Zullie…”

“Ah. No,” Zullie said. “Nope. If  you’re forming a wandering theater troupe, I quit.”

Arkk shook his head with a small chuckle. Crossing his arms, he looked down at her. This was the main reason *he* wanted to go to Cliff. Alya… was more of a side project. Important to Ilya, of course, and thus important to Arkk as well. But…

The Cliff Magical Academy, even beyond the possible fortress it held, had things he both wanted and likely needed.

“Zullie, how close are you and Savren to finishing the modifications on the ritual?”

Zullie’s lips squished together, making her look like someone who ate a particularly rancid piece of fruit. “If he wasn’t such—”

“No complaints, just timeframe.”

She drew in a deep breath through her nose. “A few weeks? Maybe months if he keeps… He keeps trying to insert minor nodes that I am pretty sure will destabilize a planar array but that he claims will recycle magic. There is some merit to the idea, doubly so given we’re not exactly sure about your magical output—”

Arkk held up a hand, stalling the witch before she could launch into a full dissertation. A few weeks was too long for the Duke’s party or Hawkwood’s invitation. He would have to proceed without any support from alternate planes of existence.

Or rather, he would have to proceed to ensure the ritual was a success.

“When we left Cliff the first time around,” Arkk said, “we left in a hurry, leaving behind some of your books. Would grabbing those help? Or any other material at the Cliff Academy?”

Zullie’s eyes shifted over to Edvin for just a moment before flicking back to Arkk. “I’m not sure that I’m all that interested in getting in the way of the inquisitors either. Especially because they know me. I know I said I have experience dodging them but this is a bit of a different level than what I’ve seen in the past.”

“I won’t be able to figure out what you might need on my own,” Arkk said just as a thought occurred to him. “But Savren was able to disguise himself as a gorgon for an extended period. Could that be used just to look like someone else?”

“You want to take him with you? Oh please! I’d get so much more work done.”

“No! No… I don’t think I could stand the snide sneering and snippy snarks. He would be dead before we leave the fortress. But you are brilliant.”

“Thank you.”

“Brilliant enough to learn his spells?”

Zullie’s eyes found the ceiling where they stayed for a long few seconds before slowly dropping back down. “There are a few tomes that might be worth investigating. Restricted stuff, not books from my office. We could double-check our work with anathema. The few surviving scraps of ancient spellcasters who actually practiced planar magics… Yes… That might be valuable enough to risk it.”

*Those* were the words Arkk wanted to hear. “Excellent. Having definitive resources on hand will hopefully prevent you two from changing the designs at the last minute again.”

“The original designs would have worked,” Zullie huffed, crossing her arms. “Just a little *too* well.”

Arkk just shook his head, already moving on. “Khan.”

The gorgon looked up, glaze receding from his eyes. He opened his mouth in a yawn wide enough to swallow Lexa whole, showing off his fangs and tongue at the same time. While Arkk somewhat expected those present to stay awake for the duration of the meetings, he honestly didn’t know what contribution Khan could make. He was here mostly as a courtesy, keeping the gorgon looped into the goings on of Fortress Al-Mir.

“Unfortunately, based on my previous visit to the city, they tolerate non-humans more than accept them. In your case, I’m not sure you would get that much. I’m afraid you won’t be going.”

“Undersstood,” Khan said. “Zharja might be dissappointed. No other will care.”

Arkk nodded and moved around the table to the next seat over. Another member of the table who had yet to speak. She was the *reason* Khan had a warm rock that was putting him to sleep. “Agnete, how much danger is there in you visiting Cliff?”

The purifier hummed, black lips parting toward the end of the tone. “Our excursion to the slaver encampment was… different than usual. Flames call to me and I cannot reject that call. Yet, I cannot quite explain the oddity of it. There was next to no desire to incinerate anyone beyond the slavers. It was a… curious experience. I believe I will have no trouble remaining in control.”

Arkk stared a long moment, wondering how close they had all been to suffering a fiery demise. He felt disturbingly aware of the sudden shift in the room’s air. Everyone, *including* Khan, stared. “I meant… danger from the inquisitors.”

“Ah.” A gloved finger scratched a scarred chin. “My appearance is distinct. The others will become aware of me as soon as we arrive. If they have not acquired an additional Binding Agent, they will likely leave me alone. Depending on the threat they have ascribed to you and the horror,” Agnete said with a nod toward him and Vezta, “they may well steer clear entirely or decide we are too great a prize to pass up. I cannot guess either way.”

“I see… I think… I’ll have you come, if you don’t mind.”

“My duties?”

“Toss fire at the inquisitors if they do anything other than have a nice chat.”

“Understood.”

Rekk’ar drew in a heavy breath, groaning as he shifted where he sat. “So we are doing this. I don’t know why I bother.”

“I hope you will continue to bother,” Arkk said, offering the orc a smile. “The time I take your advice will likely be the time it saves my life.”

The orc rolled his eyes. “My point exactly,” he said, though Arkk was pleased to note a lack of hostility in his mildly resigned tone.

“I would like a list of the least notorious of the orcs who are willing to venture to the city. Make sure they know the possible dangers—though with Vezta and I present, I imagine they will be ignored in favor of us. I’ll need the list soon as I intend for our tailor to make up uniforms for all of us.”

“I’ll set Dakka on it.”

“This is a trap,” Olatt’an said, the final member of the table. “You have not forgotten that, correct.”

“I have not. But, as I said, this is likely our last chance to walk into the city as free people. We might not be walking *out* of the city as free people…”

“You won’t be walking out of the city at all if the inquisitors have their way.”

Arkk nodded his head. “True.”

“When springing a trap, it is generally best to have a way out.”

“Also true. I presume the inquisitors will be focused on me, Vezta, and Agnete,” he said, nodding to each as he continued to make his way back around the table. “We can handle ourselves for the most part.” Taking a seat in his chair, he looked over the assembled group. His trusted advisors and Edvin. “I have a few ideas but I would like to hear from all of you. First, Agnete, if you wouldn’t mind going over everything you know of methods the inquisitors use to incarcerate captives…”

## 62 - Return to the City of Cliff


Returning to the City of Cliff did not fill Arkk with the same sense of wonder and awe that had struck him during his first approach to the city. Cliff hadn’t changed. It was still the largest settlement he had ever seen, far larger than any regular burg, with grandiose buildings and a harbor full of ships that looked too big to float. The temple atop the island mountain in the middle of the bay gleamed in the sun of the early evening, just barely out of reach of the shadow of the mountain that gave Cliff its name.

The city hadn’t changed. Arkk had.

He knew things now. He was wholly aware of the shanty town just beyond the harbor where the non-humans of the city were effectively sequestered on their own. He knew the disparity between the Duke’s dwelling and the hovels of his citizens. He knew how useless the Duke’s armies were at securing his land—between allowing groups like Rekk’ar’s and the slavers to exist and effectively abandoning the land around Katja’s bandits to whatever criminal elements decided to move in, Arkk hadn’t the slightest clue why *anyone* was paying taxes.

Though he had a sneaking suspicion that the Duke’s men would be quite effective at subjugating any village that failed to pay.

Everything Arkk had seen on his travels had only reinforced his opinion that the Duke was a blight on the land and needed to go.

Getting past the guards at the gate had taken a bit more work this time around. Three travelers, lightly armed, weren’t a big deal. This time, Arkk was heading into the city with a retinue of nine orcs plus Dakka, Zullie, Vezta—under a heavy cloak—Agnete—also under a cloak—and Ilya. It wasn’t an army, by any means, but was a little more concerning than blighted fungus.

Which, after all his travels, Arkk still didn’t know what blighted fungus was. Even Zullie just gave him a shrug of her shoulders.

Once he flashed the invitation from the Duke, however, the gate guards changed their tones. To his surprise, the invitation came with more than just entry to the Duke’s manor. Last time, the guard had begrudgingly pointed them in the direction of what had to be the worst stayover in the city. This time, Arkk and the rest of Company Al-Mir got themselves an escort that brought them straight through to a large stayover a stone’s throw away from the garrison. Not the fancy part of the city but far better than the shanty town beyond the harbor.

The Cliff’s Edge.

“I thought we would be staying in the Primrose again,” Ilya said, looking around a large lobby furnished with fine tables and chairs made from healthy brown wood. Several others sat around, talking and eating. Unlike the Moonshine Burg stayover, Arkk hadn’t rented out the entire place just for them. It was already occupied by several individuals. Judging by their attire, the rough yet clean looks most presented, and the weapons dangling from near everyone’s belts, it seemed to be the kind of place where mercenary types gathered. Fitting, Arkk supposed.

Case in point, Arkk recognized insignias from the Order of the Claymores gathered around one table. Apart from their presence at Darkwood Burg, he didn’t know all that much about them other than that most of them were getting on in years. The majority of their members were sourced from soldiers who fought in the war between the Evestani Sultanate and Chernlock thirty years ago. Some looked up, shooting wary looks in his direction. Or, more accurately, in the direction of the orcs.

“Think they’ll be up for some games with coin on the line?” Dakka asked, voice quiet.

“Don’t start any trouble,” Arkk said, looking away. Trouble was the last thing they needed right now.

“Didn’t start trouble last time,” Dakka said, earning a glare from Arkk. “I wasn’t cheating any more than they were.”

Arkk just shook his head. In doing so, he spotted a larger group of men bearing a crest of a white shield with a black chevron. White Company. Hawkwood’s people. Verifying the authenticity of Hawkwood’s letter was among his first tasks here at Cliff—there was still the possibility of it having been forged by the inquisitors without any knowledge of Hawkwood. As long as it was real, he hoped the rest of White Company would keep any cause for rising tensions low in the area.

“Vezta?” Arkk asked as they made their way up to the second floor where the Cliff’s Edge proprietor directed them. Arkk rented out a pair of large rooms. One for the rank-and-file orcs and another for himself and the ‘officers’. With them hopefully recruiting while in the city, he wondered if he should make ranks among the members official or not. Something to decide later. “Any sign of the inquisitors?”

Vezta, holding a pair of crystal balls, each flashing different images, shook her head. “I’ve scanned every room in the building as well as those of neighboring buildings. The scrying hasn’t been blocked yet.

“They could have disabled that,” Zullie said. “Maybe using a more magically intensive method of hiding that doesn’t betray their presence, knowing you would be doing just that.”

“Like the illusion spell you used at the academy last time we were here?”

“Exactly.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, slowly opening the door to the finer of the two rooms he had rented. “We’ve showed up without any warning. We missed the date for Hawkwood’s initial invitation so they wouldn’t even have that going for them. I doubt they managed to scramble together and hide out in the twenty minutes since we arrived.”

“Unless they were scrying on us and knew we were coming. Crystal balls are rare but not unheard of and I wouldn’t put it past the church to have a few.” Zullie stepped into the room, moving warily and eying everything around her. “Let me just… *Aku menggunakan akal sehatku untuk mendeteksi aliran sihir yang aneh di sekitarku.*” She reached out and grasped hold of an invisible rope, slowly drawing it toward her chest as she turned around. She did stop and shudder upon facing Vezta but quickly shook her head and kept turning around the room. “No magic beyond our own here,” she said, moving back to Arkk. “I’ll check the other room.”

“Thank you,” Arkk said with a nod of his head. Zullie slipped past him while he and the others entered the room properly.

Although designed to be an upscale room, the beds left something to be desired. The fabric was worn and the rough wool stuffing poked through at places. It was a far cry better than the Primrose had been or even the Moonshine Burg stayover, but… Arkk had grown used to the creature comforts provided by Fortress Al-Mir. The magically generated beds were perfect in just about any way that mattered.

While the others quickly picked out places to sleep and began unloading some of their travel gear, Agnete steered clear of the beds. She simply laid down a canvas tarp in one corner of the room and sat upright in a meditative pose.

They hadn’t used the teleportation circles to reach Cliff. At least not directly. They had used them to reach a little burg to the north called Charming, from which they rented a large pair of wagons and headed out to Cliff, hopefully disguising the angle of their approach. Maybe it was paranoia. Arkk hadn’t seen any evidence that they had been watched. Still, he didn’t want to lead his enemies right back to the Cursed Forest if he could help it.

Throughout their few-day journey from Charming, Arkk learned that Agnete had to be fairly wary of where she slept. While the area around her was unlikely to erupt into a raging inferno like what they had used against the slavers, it was not uncommon for her to accidentally spark flames in her sleep. The canvas she used, left behind by the inquisitors when they escaped from the false fortress, was treated specially to avoid accidental ignition.

It wasn’t perfect, evidenced by the scattered scorch marks and one edge having charred, but it was better than any kind of regular fabric.

After allowing a short time for everyone to freshen up, Arkk gathered everyone together. “First thing first,” he said, looking around. “Vezta, Zullie, and I will head to the academy. Hopefully, we can finish our investigations before anyone hears of our arrival and—”

Three light knocks at the door made Arkk tense. He was far from the only one. The orcs never liked to be far from their weapons and traveled with their armor on. It took a hasty wave of his hand to keep them from drawing their weapons. Zullie and Ilya moved to the back corner of the room, looking mildly busy while also having a clear view of the doorway. Vezta, without a care in the world, approached the door first. With her heavy cloak covering most of her body, Arkk was hoping she would come across as a particularly unusual demihuman rather than a pre-Calamity monster.

Arkk pulled one of her crystal balls to him and quickly checked the other side of the door. Tense still, Arkk gave Vezta a nod of his head, motioning toward the door.

She opened it in such a way that it was doubtful anyone would see her face. Even once fully opened, Vezta positioned herself just behind the door so that nothing but her shoulder would be seen.

The face that appeared in the open door wasn’t familiar. The white shield and black chevron on his shoulder was. The sword at the man’s hip looked more ornamental than usable. All of which had Arkk relaxing.

“Mister Arkk of Company Al-Mir, I presume?”

Arkk slowly nodded his head. “That’s correct. And you are…”

“Neil, adjutant to Hawkwood. My Lord has heard of your arrival and wishes to meet over a meal in about an hour at the White Company Headquarters.”

“That soon, huh?” Arkk asked, putting on an easy smile that he didn’t quite feel inside. It must have been one of those he had seen down in the lobby. They knew Hawkwood wanted to meet with him and went to tell him. “We missed the dinner he invited us to and he already has another set up?”

“Hawkwood understands that this likely comes as a surprise. It will be a meal between Company Al-Mir and White Company, no one else has been invited. If you are fatigued from your journey, we might be able to put it off. However, things have been busy lately. It was fortuitous that you arrived tonight. He hasn’t had many other evenings unburdened by work.”

“No, no,” Arkk said quickly. He had wanted to check out the possible fortress within the academy as soon as possible, but if putting off a meeting with Hawkwood meant not meeting with him for a significant amount of time, it was best to get that done now. “I wanted to catch up with Hawkwood as well and apologize for missing out on his initial invitation. An hour you said? And just myself?”

The adjutant slowly looked over the room. His facial expression, hidden partially behind a bushy mustache, didn’t change but Arkk did note his eyes lingering on the orcs. “The table has open seats for six.”

“Alright. We’ll be there.”

“I will deliver the good news to Hawkwood at once.” With a slight dip of his head, he turned and walked down the hallway. Vezta slowly closed the door behind him.

“Right,” Arkk said, looking back over his team. “New plan. Zullie, Agnete, you go and try to get those books you were after. Preferably without anyone finding out that *anyone* is interested in them, least of all *us*.”

Zullie shot a wary look at Agnete, the latter of whom simply nodded her head, before nodding as well. “Right this moment?”

Arkk shook his head. “Wait until we have left. Try to slip out without being seen.”

“Easy,” Zullie said.

“Myself, Ilya, Dakka, and Vezta will go to this meal—”

“Vezta?” Ilya asked, surprised. “Is that wise? No offense.”

“She is a demihuman with a skin condition,” Arkk said with a shrug. “Nothing more. I didn’t bring her along only to keep her hidden away. Hawkwood is at least a friendly face.”

“Unless he betrayed us to the inquisitors,” Ilya grumbled.

“Unless that. If *that* has happened, we’ll be enacting plan two. Just like we talked about,” Arkk said, meeting everyone’s eyes. “I’m hoping we’re still friends, however. That will let us gauge his reactions and decide how much we need to hide her from others.”

As Arkk spoke, he glanced over to Vezta. She nodded slowly. They had already discussed most of that on the way and during planning sessions but it was always good to reinforce the lessons. Watching her expressions over the journey, especially while their group had been questioned at the gate, had been interesting. He wondered if she was nervous about being this surrounded by possible enemies or if she wasn’t wanting to meet with other people.

She didn’t protest. Arkk turned back to the group at large.

“The rest of you, head down to the lobby and mingle. Be polite. Try to get a positive rapport with everyone—especially White Company—and also distract them, if you can, to help Zullie and Agnete slip out. Nothing *disruptive*. Buy everyone a round of drinks or something. I’ll reimburse you.”

Orjja and Farr’am flashed wide grins, which quickly spread across the other orcs. He figured they would be pleased with that.

“Our *friends* should already be here,” Arkk said, looking back to Zullie. “At the Primrose. If you think you need an extra hand carrying books, they are your best bet.”

“*They*,” Zullie said, rolling her eyes. “You mean the shorter of the two.”

“Well… Yes. Best to keep *someone* around *Little Sharpened Blade* and make sure he keeps out of trouble.”

“I don’t think we’ll need help,” Zullie said, tone flat. Between that spell she had been using to pack up her books on their initial departure from Cliff and Agnete’s help, she was probably right.

“It’s just an option. Orjja, later tonight or tomorrow morning, see if you can slip away. Find our friends at the Primrose and let them know that we won’t be joining them there.” Arkk paused a moment, waiting to see if anyone had input. No one spoke, leaving him to look to the three who were heading to Hawkwood’s place. “Let’s get ready.”

***

“Arkk! Welcome back to Cliff. How was the journey? Reports had you out in Moonshine Burg. Surprised you made such good time back.”

The ox-like man that was Hawkwood stood from his place at the dining table. Or… Arkk was pretty sure it was *supposed* to be a dining table. Stacks of papers surrounded Hawkwood in a semicircle, some only a few papers thick while others were stacked up to the length of his hands. The tips of Hawkwood’s fingers were stained in ink. Was everyone deep into paperwork at this time of year or just Hawkwood and Baron Doble?

“I can’t complain. I’m sorry about missing your invitation to meet with the other mercenaries. Moonshine Burg is quite far and we weren’t able to finish our business there in time. The sudden snowfall around Cliff in the last few days didn’t help.”

“I understand,” Hawkwood said with a heavy nod of his head. “The job comes first. There will be time to meet others later.”

Arkk relaxed somewhat. That was confirmation that the letter had come from Hawkwood. And unless Hawkwood was quite the actor, it didn’t seem like the inquisitors would be waiting in the wings. They had already scried through the entire place and hadn’t found anything amiss. Again, Arkk figured it was far too early for the inquisitors to have made their move unless they had been watching Arkk’s approach for a few days.

“You look… worn out,” Arkk said, not sure if he should call attention to it. “Everything alright?”

Hawkwood had a flat face and a large, pointed nose that didn’t quite sit straight on his face. Arkk imagined it had been broken many times. However, the last time Arkk saw the man, he had been clean-shaven. Now, a haggard beard had been allowed to grow and the man had dark circles around his eyes like he hadn’t been sleeping well.

For a moment, Hawkwood smiled and looked like he was about to say one thing. That smile faltered and he slowly shook his head. “Tensions are high with Evestani at the moment,” he said with a sigh. “If it weren’t winter, we would likely be in the middle of a war. As it stands, I need to get my men into tip-top shape by spring just in case the tensions remain high. I hope the winter cools some heads but… Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. It… was one of the reasons for my invitation to meet with the other mercenary leaders. Yours isn’t a large company but it has been effective in what tasks you’ve taken on.

“But I didn’t invite you here to discuss such woes,” he said before Arkk could speak. “At least not tonight. There will be time later. For now, come, sit, eat. Or eat soon, the meal will start before long now that you’ve arrived. Ilya and Dakka, was it? Welcome. Good to see you again. And…”

“Vezta,” Arkk provided. “My… chief assistant.”

Hawkwood hummed, leaning to one side to better see underneath the hood of Vezta’s cloak. His eyes widened before he schooled his expression. “This is the one who accompanied you to Silver City?”

Arkk’s eyebrows popped up in surprise. “How…”

“Sorry. I don’t mean to imply that I’ve been spying on you.” Hawkwood started clearing away the papers in front of him, stacking them at alternating angles so that he could easily unstack them later. “White Company is a large organization with at least a few members making homes in almost every major burg. Mostly as recruiters. It is quite easy to get reports on such matters, especially when those matters make as large a splash as you’ve been managing.”

“Should have had you wear a cloak back then,” Arkk grumbled, mostly to himself, as he took the seat opposite Hawkwood.

“She was also spotted in Darkwood Burg and, recently, in Moonshine Burg.” Hawkwood motioned back toward the door. “There is a rack if you would like to remove the heavy cloak. The hearth should keep us warm enough despite the chill air outside.”

“She has a skin condition,” Arkk said as Ilya took a seat to his right.

That earned him a flat look from Hawkwood.

Sighing, Arkk gave a nod to Vezta, who headed over to the rack and took off her cloak. While within Fortress Al-Mir, Vezta often used a mass of… *herself* in place of legs, she did have the ability to form legs. Which she had done now. Her appearance was still beyond unusual, between her unusual tone of skin, an oily and liquidy appearance that extended to her ‘clothes’, and bright yellow eyes that looked like stars against black space. Arkk still hoped that proper legs pushed her more into the realm of unusual demihuman and outside the realm of pre-Calamity monster.

Hawkwood stared. To his credit, it looked like he was trying not to. It wasn’t until Vezta took a seat to Arkk’s left that he blinked. “Huh,” was all he said.

Arkk wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not. He decided not to comment—drawing attention to Vezta would just draw attention to her *other*-ness—leaving the only noise in the room that which came from Dakka as she took her seat on the opposite side of Vezta.

The table felt unbalanced with the four of them on one side and Hawkwood alone on the other. The adjutant had brought them to the room but hadn’t joined them inside. There weren’t any other guards or members of White Company around either.

“I had a question,” Arkk said, drawing attention back to himself.

“Oh?” Hawkwood forced his eyes on Arkk.

“The Duke is having a party soon. Is he… often in the habit of inviting mercenary companies to his parties?”

Hawkwood’s bushy eyebrows twitched upward for a brief moment. “I should say so. The Duke likes to show off. He invites merchants, mercenaries, nobles, lords, barons, even the King, though I dare say that *I* have never seen the King at any event I’ve attended.”

“You go often?”

“Quite so. Unfortunately. White Company is large and directly contracted by the Duke for national defense. We’re hardly the only mercenary company who attends but I would be surprised if other companies manage invitations to every single party.” He let out a shuddering sigh. “Even if I wish otherwise. Why do you ask?”

Arkk reached into his jacket. Time for another test. “What do you make of this?” he asked, placing the forged invitation from the Duke down on the table. If Hawkwood immediately spotted it as a fake then at least they wouldn’t waste their time trying to get into the party.

Hawkwood hummed, reaching for the letter. He squinted at it for a short moment before turning to the stack of papers he had shoved aside. Standing and leaning around the papers, he spotted what he was looking for. He donned the pair of half-moon glasses and quickly skimmed over the letter.

“Congratulations,” Hawkwood said, lowering the letter. “I recall you mentioned wanting to go to one of these parties. Don’t know whatever for, but it looks like your efforts have paid off. I bet it was Silver City. The Duke was quite ecstatic upon finding out that the gorgon had been dealt with.”

Arkk tried his best not to look guilty. He put on a smile and accepted the letter back. “Sorry about that. I just wanted to confirm that the Duke’s invitation to Company Al-Mir was… well, *genuine*.”

“Should it not be?” Hawkwood asked, raising a curious eyebrow.

“I… just wasn’t sure that the Duke often invited random mercenary companies to his estate for parties.”

“You wouldn’t be incorrect. Especially not a random *and* brand-new mercenary company. But I have done my part to sing your praises. Not that you needed me to do much. I say, how *did* you manage to clear out a den of gorgon from the Silver City mines?”

“I just offered them alternate employment opportunities, contingent on them turning the miners back to normal.”

Hawkwood barked out a laugh, clapping his hands together. It didn’t last long. He took one look over the table before quirking both eyebrows up his forehead. “Oh dear, you’re serious?”

“Eight gorgon work for Company Al-Mir at the moment. Paid just as much as anyone else.”

Dakka snorted. At the table’s attention turning toward her, she shifted uncomfortably. “I’m pretty sure they’re more interested in good food over coin.”

“True. Rats made up most of their diet while in those mines,” Arkk said with a shrug. “They helped out quite a bit in annihilating a group of slavers around Moonshine Burg. Surprised your recruiters didn’t mention their presence there.”

“I didn’t ask for *precise* details. Like I said, it wasn’t my intention to spy.”

“Guess we did a better job at hiding them than you,” Arkk said, looking at Vezta.

A knock at the door stalled any further conversation. A pair of servants dressed in fine black and white attire entered. They promptly began setting out places around the table. A large mat went underneath a dizzying array of silver utensils. Three forks, three knives, and three spoons, each a different size. Crystal glassware came down next. The largest was filled with water but, popping the corks on a few bottles, the servants filled the others with fine wines. Finally, the servants placed down a plate in front of each of them.

The plates had only one item on them. A lumpy red… *lump* of *something* with two green leaves arrayed as if it were a berry. Whatever it was, it was cold enough to chill the plate. Arkk expected a little more—the lumpy substance could fit entirely in the palm of his hand—but the servants bowed out and left them with just the single plate.

Dakka looked utterly flabbergasted, prodding the forks like they were live snakes. Ilya wasn’t fairing any better. Vezta, as usual, had a prim and proper ghost of a smile on her lips but she left her hands in her lap and did not move toward the meal. Arkk felt like it was his turn to pop a curious eyebrow in Hawkwood’s direction.

The man, watching their expressions, burst out into a hearty round of laughter.

“Um…”

“What luck you came today!” Hawkwood said as his laughter died down. “Especially with your invitation to the Duke’s party.”

“Is this our meal?”

“One plate out of eleven or so.” He chuckled. “I had the same expression when I first saw this.” He shook his head. “I thought I might surprise you with this but now it is *training* for the party. A custom from the Evestani Sultanate that the Duke has adopted. They call this an *Amuse-Bouche*.”

“And there are eleven of these?” Dakka asked, deciding to forego the utensils entirely as she picked up the lump of red with her fingers. It looked even smaller in her hand, not having been sized proportionally to her.

“Just one *Amuse-Bouche*. Then an appetizer. Then a second appetizer. Seafood or soup, pasta, some small portion of meat followed by a palate cleanser. We’ll then get a salad and a main course followed by two different dessert plates. And the Duke would not take kindly to anyone picking up food with their fingers. Unless, of course, that specific plate was meant to be consumed by hand.”

Dakka dropped the lump back down on the plate. Having melted somewhat from her body heat, it splattered a bit. She promptly licked her fingers, hummed a mild note of approval, and wiped her fingers off on the placemat.

“Avoid everything you just did as well,” Hawkwood said with a wide grin.

Ilya looked at Dakka with a frown before looking to Hawkwood. “Some forewarning would have been appreciated,” she said as diplomatically as possible.

“This is your forewarning! Give me a hearty roast and a pile of potatoes to shovel in my mouth any day and you’ll see me happy and full. I wouldn’t care if you lick it off your plate. But at the party in front of the Duke? This took a little bit to get used to. Lucky you, you’ve got me to show you the ropes,” he said with a wide grin as he picked up one of the many utensils on the table. Arkk had a feeling that the moment his men notified him of Arkk’s presence, he had rounded up the cooks to make this meal solely for his own amusement. Which was reassuring more than anything else that *his* letter hadn’t been an inquisitorial plot. “This is a salad fork…”

## 63 - Fallen Plans


“Still no sign of the inquisitors?”

Vezta shot Arkk a glare. An actual, genuine glare. That was, perhaps, the first time he had ever seen her in any way upset with him.

He simply raised an eyebrow.

“No, Master. Rest assured that I will inform you the moment I detect any suspicious activity. You do not need to ask me every five steps.”

“Just making sure,” Arkk said.

Twenty-four hours inside Cliff and still no trap sprung. He was fairly confident that the letter from Hawkwood had been genuine now but that didn’t mean that the inquisitors would just sit back and watch them. With every step they took, he felt like suddenly turning around just to catch the inquisitors trying to sneak up on him. A useless gesture while Vezta was at his side. She had a crystal ball in her hand and eyes literally on the back of her head. There was no chance that he would notice something amiss before she did.

That didn’t make the sensation that they were being watched go away.

“Zullie, was there ever any progress on detecting when we’re being magically watched?”

“Was that something I was supposed to do?” Zullie half turned, meeting his eyes as they walked through the halls of the Cliff Magic Academy. “First I’m hearing of it. I’ve had all my efforts focused on the ritual lately. You don’t want me to reprioritize, do you?”

“No. No. Definitely not. I just…” Arkk drew in a breath and let it back out in a clipped sigh. “I think I need more magical researchers. Don’t suppose walking through here has jogged your memory of some other casters who have gotten into trouble with inquisitors in the past, has it?”

“Not particularly. And scrying is a rarity. I imagine most kings and the church have methods of scrying. Maybe old warlocks who have managed to inherit magical artifacts. Hardly anyone else. The Abbey of the Light maintains a monopoly on methods of detection and avoidance. I imagine that is precisely because they don’t want people hiding from *their* eyes.”

That was not the first time Arkk had heard that something he wanted to do was exclusively within the domain of the church. Avoiding mental magics came to mind. If the church didn’t want counter-scrying knowledge public so that they could scry, it did make him wonder if a similar issue had them blocking mental magics as well. One more reason to avoid the church… Though…

“I don’t suppose you know of any corrupt priests or abbesses who would know such things?”

“Aside from the healer we have on hand for accidents and injuries, the academy doesn’t have much interaction with any member of the church.”

“I wonder how hard it would be to find someone…”

“Corrupt individuals exist in every profession,” Zullie said, frowning. “It’s just a matter of having something to offer that they think is worth risking their position.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.” He didn’t know that he would find an opportunity to use that tidbit but he would have to keep an ear out for anyone the church wound up angry with. Maybe they would post bounties on former priests.

Dismissing the idea for the time being, he turned to Vezta and opened his mouth.

She glared. “*No*, Master, the inquisitors are *not* on our tail at this time.”

Arkk clamped his jaw shut, pursing his lips. “I was just going to ask what you thought about this place?” he said, waving his hands along the corridor.

They had been walking through the Cliff Academy for some time. Not wanting anyone to know of his interest in the place, Zullie had used a spell from Savren that made them look like whoever a viewer most expected to be in any given place. Which was a spell powerful enough that it was no wonder that the church had labeled mind magics as anathema.

Though, Zullie did say that it had some drawbacks. Any spellcaster would be able to tell, entirely passively, that a large amount of magic was being used in their vicinity. Trying to use it to slip into the garrison would likely have them arrested in moments. The academy, already inundated with magic from research and training, made it far more difficult to tell that something was amiss. Even if someone did notice the magic expenditure, it wouldn’t be thought of as anything out of the ordinary here.

After having passed through the populated areas of the academy, Zullie had dropped the spell. It worked by affecting nearby minds so anyone scrying on them would have already known, thus making the effort pointless this far into the academy.

They had made it to the back corridors. The same dusty halls that he and Zullie had used to escape from Agnete just before leaving Cliff the first time around. Now that he was looking at them again, he wasn’t quite so sure of his earlier assessment. Fortress Al-Mir had perfect walls, straight and smooth with fine tiles and the regular glowstone marking the path. Even before he took over, when it had been in a more dilapidated state, it still retained that regularity and ruggedness.

The back tunnels of Cliff Academy wound and wove, twisted and turned. The corridors weren’t all the same width or height. This particular path allowed five orcs to stand shoulder to shoulder. The hallway before, however, barely let him walk alongside Vezta and Zullie. One set of stairs up to a higher level had been narrow and steep, almost like climbing a ladder, while another set of stairs felt more like a gradual ramp. More of an incline than proper stairs.

Glowstones dotted the corridor now and again. Arkk wasn’t surprised to find them all dim and inert. Zullie had grabbed a few bright amber glowstones to light their way through the dim tunnels. The tunnels didn’t *feel* like they had been constructed through the magic of lesser servants. Rather, it looked like it had been dug out by men with picks. Or dwarves. Wasn’t that who was *supposed* to have created what was now used as the academy?

It just… didn’t feel like Fortress Al-Mir.

Maybe it shouldn’t. It *wasn’t*, after all. When Vezta had mentioned other fortresses with other [HEART] artifacts at their core, he had pictured identical clones of Fortress Al-Mir. Was that the case? The only other *confirmed* fortress he had seen was the one in Darkwood. And that one he hadn’t actually *seen*. He had been too preoccupied with the defense and, later, his injuries to even scry on it. Had it been a regular labyrinth of connected corridors or had it been a maze of tunnels more akin to an ant colony?

Vezta was looking around now. With her multitude of eyes, she could keep watch of the crystal ball at the same time. Arkk guessed that this human-like gesture was more for his sake than out of an actual need to look around. He appreciated it.

“There are elements that make me scoff and say that this couldn’t have ever been a proper fortress,” Vezta started, speaking slowly as if to gather her thoughts. “I would almost suggest that we turn around and cease wasting our time. But then I’ll spot something familiar. An arch in the ceiling, a tile on the floor, the shape of a doorway,” she said, nodding to an open doorway whose door must have long since fallen.

“So… it is a fortress? Or isn’t it?”

“The [HEART] of a fortress is a gift from the [PANTHEON]. However, *which* member of the [PANTHEON] *primarily* offered the gift can influence the appearance and function of the fortress. In a way, this place reminds me of Unknown, the Enigma. A maze of corridors turning in on each other, impossible to tell how far we’ve gone or how far we’ve come. Every landmark we spot is unique and yet has a familiarity that leads us to believe that we’ve passed this point before…”

“That… sounds dangerous,” Arkk said, looking around the corridor once again. Had they already been this way? The dusty hallways hadn’t been disturbed yet. They were leaving a trail of footprints in their wake, so they *should* be able to escape. But… “Zullie, didn’t you say that sometimes academics would wander back into these tunnels only to never be seen again?”

“Stories,” Zullie said. “Fictional stories. Probably.”

“It wouldn’t surprise me,” Vezta said, continuing forward even as Arkk stopped. “Something wrong?”

“If these tunnels are *designed* to trap people, is it wise to continue?”

“*If*,” Vezta said. “I am not wholly convinced that these tunnels weren’t simply dug out by mortal hands. Or perhaps men discovered the tunnels and then dug into them, damaging the original layout or erected walls, changing the size and shape of the corridors. Even if this *is* a fortress owing favor to Unknown, the Enigma, it is quite clearly inactive and dormant. No actual magic will trap us. We can always follow our trail to escape.”

“We’re sure?”

In lieu of a verbal response, Vezta cocked her head, approached the closest wall, and raised a tendril that split off from her side. A gaping maw of razor-sharp teeth formed, looking much like the mouths of the lesser servants. She plunged it straight into the wall, easily consuming the brick and stone. Pulling back, she looked to Arkk.

“*If* this is a fortress, it is entirely inactive. Even more so than Fortress Al-Mir was when you first discovered it. Failing every other method of escape, I could dig a tunnel out. There is no danger of us becoming trapped in an enigmatic maze.”

That did offer some relief. There was another problem, unfortunately. “Next question: Are we wandering aimlessly or do you have a way of telling where the Heart might be?”

Vezta looked around again, this time with a deepening frown. “This place is inert. I cannot sense where the [HEART] might be, if there is one.”

“That’s a problem. According to Zullie, these caves encompass nearly the entire mountain. We could be wandering for weeks with no luck. And that’s assuming it is *possible* to find and not walled off.”

“My feet are already protesting,” Zullie grumbled, moving to lean up against the wall. “I’d rather not pick paths at random.”

“Any ideas?” Arkk asked, looking from the witch to the servant. Neither spoke up, leading to Arkk letting out a small groan. “It’s pitch dark. Scrying won’t work. After they’re finished securing our escape routes, if I order the lesser servants to zig-zag their way through in the hopes that they find something, is there a possibility that they might damage the Heart?”

Vezta chuckled, which was more than enough of an answer. She still added, “Not likely. Though they may cause collapses and other problems elsewhere in the mountain.”

Arkk clicked his tongue. Although Vezta prefaced her statements with ifs, Arkk was a little more confident that this *was* a fortress, even if it wasn’t like his own. Unfortunately, he was significantly less confident that they would be able to utilize it in an appreciable amount of time.

“*Slave Natum*,” he intoned, springing forth six fresh lesser servants. The pulsing masses of oily flesh, bulbous eyes, and gaping maws stared up at him, patiently awaiting his commands. He didn’t need to use words to command them but, for the benefit of Vezta and Zullie, he said, “Split up and wander the corridors. Alert me if you find anything. Do not get seen by anyone. If you find a populated area, turn back and try other routes. If you are at risk of discovery…” Arkk pressed his lips together. Vezta had assured him that they could barely think but it still left a sour taste in his mouth when they died. “Self-terminate.”

In an eerie unison, the lesser servants turned away, moving down the corridor. As they passed by doors on the sides of the hall, one or two would split off. In short order, he was alone with Vezta and Zullie once again.

“I don’t expect them to find anything *soon*,” Arkk said. “But maybe we’ll get lucky.”

“We’re leaving then?” Zullie asked, sounding excited.

“Yes. But keep this in the back of your minds. If you have any ideas on how to find the Heart, assuming there is one. Lower priority than the ritual but it is important to our long-term goals.”

Unfortunately, unless the lesser servants came up with something soon, it didn’t look like they would be able to use this as territory to teleport to if things went poorly in the city. They might be able to escape to it but they would have to go on foot.

Better to use the other lesser servants who were already burrowing tunnels underneath the city.

***

Dakka swirled a fine glass of ruby-red wine. Going in for a drink, she carefully watched her opponents over the top of its rim. Her eyes shifted from one human to the next. Then the one after. They were harder to read than the undisciplined scum around the Primrose. A result of the training they underwent with their respective mercenary companies, undoubtedly.

Even still, she could see it in their eyes.

Here was the big, dumb orc with loaded pockets, here to play games at the human table.

Wishing that the wine glass was a proper flagon just so that she could set it down with a little more force, Dakka picked up a gold coin and tossed it into the pile at the center of the table.

Her opponents balked. They didn’t do anything so overt as to grimace or groan. The way their fingers moved over their cards and coins told enough.

One bore the white shield with a single black chevron, upward facing, on the breast of his white suit. White Company. Their allies, at least for the moment, though she doubted he would have any qualms over cleaning her out. He bet risky but had the luck to prop himself up. No sign of cheating that she had been able to spot. The gold piece seemed a bit too much for him despite the pot being worth almost five before Dakka’s addition. After thinking for a moment, he folded.

The woman across from Dakka wore a metal brooch pinning a heavy black cloak over her shoulders. The brooch was shaped like an upward-thrusting claymore, surrounded by the wings of a bird… which made it look more like a trident than a proper sword. Dakka didn’t know much about the Order of the Claymores other than that a small contingent of them had been dispatched to Darkwood Burg in search of Gretchen, Viscount Wesley’s daughter. They had helped with the defense later on… which meant that this person, whether or not she had been present herself, likely knew of Vezta and possibly even the teleportation circles that Arkk wanted to keep quiet.

Dakka wasn’t sure what to do with that information. That was something for Arkk to think about. All Dakka knew was that this woman had lost more than anyone else at the table. Dakka still gave her a respectful nod when the woman slid over twin stacks of silver coins.

The last at the table might not have been human. He wore a solid black robe-like suit, complete with gloves, a high neck, and a wide-brimmed hat. Only his head was visible and yet, Dakka couldn’t see a single hair poking out under his hat or on his face. Nor any evidence that hair had ever grown. To make matters a little more suspicious, he wore black lenses with leather shields blocking any peripheral vision. The glass was so dark that Dakka wondered how he could even see his cards.

Maybe some kind of lizard beastman. Whatever he was, he tossed in a gold piece of his own, turning a toothless smile back to Dakka.

“Company Al-Mir, is it?” he said, speaking a little strangely as he kept his lips firmly over his teeth. An odd move that only reinforced Dakka’s suspicion. “Quite the stellar rise to prominence.”

Dakka tapped her knuckles against the table twice before looking up to meet his gaze. Even with the glasses, she could tell that he wasn’t looking at her but at the emblem she wore on her chest. The compass rose backed with an intricate maze. “Boss-man is ambitious,” she said with a shrug.

“Makes quite the use of non-humans. Elves and orcs. Gorgon too, if rumors hold.”

“They are,” Dakka said, watching the table as one final card joined the other four. “Looking for a job?” she asked as she tossed in another ten silvers.

With the man from White Company out already, that left the woman from the Order of the Claymores to hum and haw over whether or not to add to the pot. Although her face was perfectly expressionless, the length of her hesitation spoke volumes.

“I might be. What kind of long-term goals and aspirations does Company Al-Mir hold? What kind of benefits do you offer? Does the leader use you as fodder or does he care?”

“Last question first: I’d say he cares a bit too much.”

“How so?” The question didn’t come from the glasses-wearing possible non-human but from the soldier from White Company.

Dakka glanced over just as a clink of coins joined the pot. After the Claymore tossed her coins in, the non-human instantly threw in a full gold coin. From his earlier betting, Dakka hadn’t expected such a confident display. Her eyes drifted to the last card flipped, trying to figure out how likely it was that he had a better hand than she did.

“He does foolish things on occasion,” she said, using the question to buy her a moment to think. “Shoves an orc out of the way of an attack and takes the hit himself despite our armor and tougher hide. Goes in by himself if he thinks the situation is too dangerous. We’ve taken on several dangerous tasks and only just lost one—to his own idiocy, I might mention. No one else took more than a few nicks and cuts. I think Arkk took it a bit hard. The rest of us…” she shrugged, tossing in twenty silver to match her bet with the man in the hat.

“You didn’t care?” the White Company man asked with a frown.

“Me specifically?” Dakka scoffed. “Rolling his body into a ditch would have been more than he deserved. But he and I had a bit of history. Arkk gave him a full cultural burial.”

“I see,” the hatted man said, watching as the Claymore cautiously matched their bets. “Are conflicts among the rank-and-file common?”

“Get any group of people together and there are going to be some who can’t stand others. That said, we don’t fight much. Outside the pit, of course. Arkk made it clear that he wouldn’t stand for any real fighting early on.”

The hatted man hummed and, nodding to himself, threw in *another* gold coin. “Benefits?”

“Lodging, food, and equipment are all provided and he knows some healing spell to keep us from suffering from most injuries.” Dakka paused and then grinned. She pulled out a pair of gold coins. “Pay is good enough to keep up with you as well,” she said, tossing them into the pot.

White Company’s soldier laughed at the display. The Claymore, on the other hand, dropped her expressionless act in favor of a heavy scowl. The stack of coins in front of her wasn’t anywhere near enough to match and she knew it.

“He hire humans too?” she asked, slamming her cards against the table. Dakka would have accepted her putting everything into the pot even if she couldn’t match but it seemed like the woman wasn’t interested.

Probably for the best.

“Claymores don’t pay well?” Dakka asked with a grin.

“Apparently not,” she huffed.

“Well,” the hatted man said, looking from the large pot to Dakka. “And goals for the organization?”

“Help some people out. Make money while doing it.”

With a drawn-out hum, the man placed his cards against the table. “I’ll have to consider my options,” he said, standing. Touching his gloved hand to the brim of his hat, he turned and stalked away from the table. Dakka turned in her seat, watching him head over to the entrance to the stayover. A second after he left, Arkk and his entourage entered.

“Something I said?” Dakka asked with a frown, earning nothing but shrugs from the other two at the table.

“Never seen him before.”

“Same.”

“Huh.” Shrugging, Dakka started dragging the large pot of coins over to herself. The Claymore reached out for Dakka’s cards, only to freeze as a heavy hand clamped around her wrist.

“Not even going to show your cards?”

“Then you’ll know if I was bluffing or not,” Dakka said, all smiles as she squared her cards into the deck before anyone could see them. With a wink, she tossed out a gold coin to each of the mercenaries and scraped the rest into her already-loaded pouch. “Get a few drinks on me instead. And that is the boss-man,” she said, thumbing over her shoulder as Arkk passed. “If that was genuine interest in swapping companies, I’m sure he would be happy to hear you out.”

The Claymore looked a little uncomfortable at the comment, though she was happy to keep the offered gold. Her eyes followed Arkk for a long minute until he disappeared up the stairs.

“I’m going to talk to him for a bit. Assuming he has no tasks for me, I’ll be back later, offering anyone a chance to earn some of this back,” she said patting the pouch.

Heading up the stairs after Arkk, she had to wonder what their reactions would be if they knew just how much she had been bluffing. Both about her cards and about the goals of Company Al-Mir. Claiming to want to overthrow a kingdom would be more believable than reverting the Calamity.

## 64 - Scouting Mission


“So that’s it?” Arkk asked, looking out over the wide gardens and open plazas that made up the promontory that jutted out into the ocean. The grounds looked idyllic, the kind of place where fairy-tale princesses would frolic during the day. At night, the white stone walls would provide plentiful security for a peaceful rest.

Clinging to the roof of a building with Ilya at his side wasn’t how he pictured his day going when Ilya said she could get their eyes on the Duke’s manor. He wouldn’t, under pain of death, admit to being afraid of heights. The way his foot kept sliding down the mist-slicked slate tiles of the roof sent butterflies through his stomach. The mist having turned to frost in the chill air didn’t help his traction any. He had one gloved hand firmly gripping the edge of the roof and his other hand wishing it could find purchase.

He had half a mind to grab hold of Ilya’s leg. Under other circumstances, he might have admired the view of the elf pressed down against the roof just above him. The way she clung to the building with surety and grace would have been beautiful if not for the quick spikes of adrenaline that shot through Arkk’s stomach every time he felt himself sliding downward.

Grabbing hold of her wouldn’t have been a good idea, unfortunately. He would just end up dragging her down as well. Vezta waited at the bottom. He had to hope that her reflexes would be enough to catch him if he did fall.

“Are you listening?”

Arkk flicked his eyes from the toned thighs of the woman sharing the roof to her face. “Yes?”

Ilya rolled her eyes. “Better watch it. I might kick you off.”

“You wouldn’t.”

“You were thinking about grabbing my ass.”

“Maybe. Could you blame me?”

“No. I’d still kick you off.”

“Harsh but fair, I suppose,” Arkk said with a sigh, trying to play it cool even as his foot slipped off the lower edge of the roof again. “You know, we never get time to ourselves anymore. There is always something needing doing or people around. After we get your mother out of there, we should go hunting again. Just the two of us.”

“Arkk, focus, please.”

“Sorry. Just nervous being up here with such a lovely lady.”

“Lies.”

“Maybe,” Arkk admitted, turning his head to try to find any kind of lip or edge that he could plant his foot against without it just sliding off.

“*Anyway*, if you’re done acting the love-sick fool…” Ilya’s sharp eyes turned back over the side of the roof. The crazy elf actually let go of the roof with one of her hands to point off into the distance. “I was trying to say that the tower over there was where the magical defenses were. I think, anyway. I don’t know much about magic but the tower glowed and then the harpy couldn’t escape.”

Edging ever so slightly closer to the edge of the roof, Arkk peered around it from his lower vantage point. He could see the tall tower jutting up from the far end of the Duke’s keep. Maybe there were people up there? He could see movement but that could easily be a flag shuffling in the chill gusts of wind.

“There are four people up there. Two look like regular guards, the same as anywhere else along the walls. Two are wearing robes. Spellcasters, I assume.”

“Why robes?”

Ilya managed to shrug without losing her grip on the roof. “Maybe the Duke likes them in robes so he can easily tell apart spellcasters from rank-and-file.”

“And you think there is a ritual circle up there?”

“Something glowed. You’re the magic expert. You tell me.”

“Zullie is the magic expert. I *might* be able to tell you what it does if I could see it. My eyes aren’t as good as yours. Can you describe it?”

“Can’t see the floor from here. Or anything else that looked like it might have been glowing.”

“Dang.” Much like churches or wherever inquisitors were suspected of being, scrying anywhere near the Duke’s manor failed. They hadn’t been able to get a good, in-depth overview of the place. If they could scry on it, there was no way Ilya would have convinced him to climb up to the top of the roof, enticing view of her backside or not. “Those are probably not the manor’s only defenses. Magically speaking. Zullie said that a lot of work went into its design. Some aspects of the manor’s defenses are studied in the academy but a lot of it is either secret—for security reasons—or were developed by the church.”

“Will it be a problem if there are more defenses?”

“I have no idea. If there is nothing else, shall we get down?”

“I thought you wanted to map out the place.”

“Yes, well, as it turns out, my hands are a bit busy,” Arkk said, adjusting his grip on the edge of the roof. “I’ll just have to remember it for later.”

“From what Hawkwood said, that large wing with the glass ceiling is likely where we’ll be for most of the party.”

“Opposite side of the keep from the tall tower. Not ideal but possibly not a problem. Won’t know until we go in, I suppose. We have no idea what the interior looks like and I really can’t see anything from here anyway.”

“It would help if you weren’t staring at me.”

“Ilya,” Arkk said, putting on his most suave smile. “How do we get back down?”

The elf blinked at the non-sequitur. “Climb?”

“Backwards?”

“No. Head first,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Just the reverse of how you got up here. Dangle your legs over the edge and find the notches you used to get up. The brickwork is jagged enough that there are plenty.”

As if to demonstrate, Ilya let go entirely. She slid down the slick roof right until her boots hit the lower edge. Some elven magic must have kicked in because she stopped with her boots dangling just past the rooftop. However, she didn’t stop for long. A slight wiggle in her waist sent her over the edge. Her boots made faint clacks as they struck the wall and, in a graceful display, she was upright clinging to the roof and the wall.

“Just like that. Easy.”

“Easy,” Arkk said. “Maybe you should send Vezta up for me when you get down.”

Ilya was probably going to strain something with how much she was rolling her eyes. “Come on,” she said, using only one hand to hold onto the roof as she planted a hand on *his* backside. “I’ll guide you. Just let go and—”

Arkk, doing as he was told, let go of the side of the roof. Only for a moment. As soon as he started sliding back, he tried to clamp hold of it again. The frosty roof slipped through his gloves without purchase.

In an instant, Arkk felt his stomach drop out from under him. The rest of him followed.

“Arkk!”

The building they had been using as a vantage point was a three-story building. Tall enough that his uncontrolled tumble would break his neck on impact but not so tall as to offer time to do anything. As Arkk flipped off the roof, he spotted two bright yellow eyes glowing from under the hood of a cloak. Was Vezta going to catch him? Could she?

He didn’t have time to think of the answers.

Arkk spoke the two words he thought might save him in that instant.

“*Cranium Internum*.”

Arkk slammed into the ground.

Except, it didn’t hurt. It wasn’t even a fast fall. More like he had toppled backward out of a chair onto a soft mat. He still let out a long, feminine groan, more out of the expectation of pain rather than feeling anything. Slamming a hand into his face and dragging it down, he slowly sat up and opened his eyes.

And opened his eyes.

And opened his eyes.

A cascade of visions, each more bizarre and unsettling than the last, assaulted Arkk. The world he beheld through the eyes of this inhuman entity was unlike anything he ever could have imagined.

Just a few moments ago, it had been a cold, overcast day. Entirely ordinary for early winter. The colors were dull and muted, looking drab. There had been no sign of the sun even though it should have been visible over the top of Cliff’s mountains.

Now, the overcast sky was gone, replaced with a shattered black void that stretched eternally. Distant specks of light looked nothing like normal stars. They were eyes like Vezta’s, staring back down at him, watching his every move. *Waiting*. Waiting for what? They wanted something.

He could feel it.

He could *hear* it.

Whispers, faint and haunting, called down from the shattered sky. Their words meant nothing to him. Secrets from ages long past or casual conversation around a tavern fire. It could have been either.

Fear coiled in his chest, feeling small and insignificant. He was merely one tiny speck of dust next to the [STARS] above. And yet, amidst that terror and shrinking feeling, an ember of curiosity ignited deep within. *This* was where Vezta had come from. Distant. So far away that only gods could reach. He could see it.

Arkk. Farmboy-turned-mercenary leader was now witnessing a sight that no other being had witnessed.

Something moved to block his view. Ilya’s face obscured the shattered sky. She looked down with worry and panic, hands clamping down on Arkk’s shoulders. For some reason, Arkk expected her to look different. Maybe something subtle, a distortion to her features, or maybe something obvious like transparent skin revealing blood, bone, and organs. But she was just Ilya. Beautiful with her elven features.

The ground was the ground. The bricks were bricks. It was only the sky above that had changed.

“—happened to Arkk? He fell and… I panicked and…”

Arkk blinked and blinked and blinked and blinked. He could hear her words and her voice but… those unintelligible whispers from the [STARS] were so fascinating…

“Arkk is safe,” his mouth responded of its own accord. “Startled, I think. Master, if you can hear me, it would be wise to end the spell.”

Spell? Spell.

*Cranium Internum*. He was possessing Vezta. Of course he was. She was the only other in the entire world who saw what he was seeing now. Spell. End spell.

Arkk stumbled back from Vezta’s body, slamming into Ilya and knocking them both to the ground. Ilya, startled, started to shove him off only to realize who he was. She immediately wrapped her arms around him.

“Are you okay? You slipped and… I’m sorry! I should have had a better grip on you or…”

Ilya continued apologizing. Arkk just sat back, head against her soft chest. The awe and shock faded slowly as he stared up at the gray, overcast sky. Eventually, it reached a point where he sucked in a sharp breath. Arkk blinked. Had he been breathing before?

“Arkk?”

“I’m fine,” Arkk said slowly, words feeling strangely unfamiliar in his mouth. He licked his lips and shook his head, forcing himself to blink several more times. “Fine. Sorry for scaring you.”

“Scare me? I almost jumped down after you but then you just vanished.”

“He possessed me,” Vezta said when Arkk didn’t speak right away.

“Possessed?”

“I only used it once before. Testing with Zullie,” Arkk said, closing his eyes as he rested back against Ilya. Shaking out his arms, he started feeling a little more normal. “Not a spell I *like* to use—or even like the idea of—but it was the only thing that popped into my mind in my panic.”

“I would have caught you.”

Arkk nodded his head. “I figured but wasn’t completely sure…” Trailing off, he looked upward again. A regular, overcast sky hung overhead. “What…” he started, only to find himself unable to finish the question. “Are they still there?”

Ilya, behind him, tilted her head back to follow his gaze. “Are *what* still there?”

“The [STARS],” Arkk said.

Vezta nodded. “Always.”

“What are they saying?”

A pained look crossed Vezta’s face for a brief moment before she adopted her usual pleasant expression. “I don’t know,” she said, pointing a finger upward. “It’s broken.”

Arkk nodded slowly. That made sense… even if it didn’t. He hadn’t been able to understand them either. Those whispers, now gone, might have been nothing more than his imagination. He was sure that there had been words—even words he understood—but the meaning of the concepts failed to translate. Vezta’s [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE] worked so why wouldn’t that?

Because it was broken.

The shattered sky.

“The Calamity?” Arkk asked, only for Vezta to slowly shake her head.

“No. The sky shattered long before the Calamity. Long before the [PANTHEON] or this world existed. Primordial beings that were the first and will be the last,” she said with a smile. “I wouldn’t worry about it.”

“But those are *them*, aren’t they? The [STARS]. The things the inquisitors fear and the things the gorgon could smell on me.”

“True. I do not know what the inquisitors fear *for*, however. They cannot meaningfully interact with any plane of existence. Even if they knew we were planning on reverting the Calamity, that wouldn’t be enough to fix the shattered skies. As for the gorgon, my kind was typically allied with those from other planes—which, the gorgon do hail from the [UNDERWORLD] originally.”

“Your kind… There *are* more of you?”

“*Were*. I feel like I would know if others had survived. I thought the [HEART] of Fortress Al-Mir beating once more would call to them. That none have responded is telling.”

“Sorry,” Arkk said, earning a shrug. “What… how did you get here if interaction is impossible?”

“[PANTHEON]. Specifically, Xel’atriss, Lock and Key.”

“The god of boundaries and barriers?” Arkk said, remembering Vezta’s introduction when they first created the temple room.

“The only being any have seen capable of reaching through the broken skies. She offered experience as opposed to observation. *They* couldn’t come through, even with the Lock and Key’s power, so they sent us [SERVANTS] in their place.”

Arkk licked his lips, trying one more time to ask the question he wasn’t sure he wanted to hear the answer to. “What are they?”

“Primordial beings. The first and the last. They have no true name. But, as I am a [SERVANT] and was one before Fortress Al-Mir, the most apt term for them would be the [MASTERS].”

That feeling of curiosity and unease melded together at hearing the term pounded through his skull with the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE]. A discordant hum escaped his lips. At his back, even Ilya flinched and her breathing hitched. A feeling of insignificance threatened to crush him until Vezta reached forward, planting a hand on his.

“As I said, I wouldn’t worry. Or think about it. It is what it is and nothing any of us do will change that.”

Arkk shuddered but nodded his head. And to think Vezta’s former master possessed her often. Well, if they stayed within Fortress Al-Mir, he probably wouldn’t have seen the sky all that much. Even still, he had to have seen it. Now that Arkk had seen it, did he want to see it again?

The question brought up a void in Arkk’s mind. He wouldn’t say yes. At the same time, he couldn’t quite bring himself to say no. Perhaps, after a time to get used to the idea, he would decide one way or the other. For now, he just nestled back against Ilya, not making any attempt to disentangle himself from her arms.

Tragically, her head twitched to one side the way it did when her sharp ears caught an interesting sound. “I don’t quite know what is going on… I hear footsteps and voices approaching. They probably heard us shouting and are here to investigate. We don’t want to be caught spying on the Duke’s manor. Besides, you were supposed to meet with those Claymores who wanted to switch companies.”

“But it is so comfortable here,” Arkk said, pressing himself further against Ilya’s chest.

She looked down, frowned, and promptly shoved him off to the side. It was a halfhearted shove at best. Still, it got him off her. He stood slowly, not quite steady on his feet. Ilya grabbed one arm to steady him. At the same time, Vezta grabbed his other.

“Maybe we can snuggle later.”

“In your dreams.”

“I guess that will have to do,” Arkk grumbled.

With that, Ilya took the lead, using her senses to keep them from encountering anyone.

The entire way back to the stayover, Arkk found himself glancing upward every so often.

## 65 - Interviews


Wealthy merchants, knights and lords, and other *important people*, tended toward the far grander stayovers not far from the Duke’s manor. The Cliff’s Edge, situated near the garrison and nowhere near any cliff’s edge, was still the kind of place where people like Alma wouldn’t normally be allowed inside. It was a fine building, one of the taller ones around, made of hearty wood washed yearly with a glaze to fend off the corrosive ocean air. The washing had been done just a few months prior, leaving it gleaming in what little morning light made it through the overcast skies.

“This the place?”

Alma shrugged at Kelsey’s question. “How should I know? It isn’t like they passed out a notice, now is it?”

Luther, teeth clattering in a nervous tic that he couldn’t control, pointed toward the main entrance. “L-Look. Beastmen. T-This has to be the place.”

Following his gesture, Alma frowned. Luther was right in that a line had formed around the exterior of the building. Beastmen, demihumans, and even some humans were all gathered up. The latter two groups huddled together—while maintaining some minor distance between themselves—to better fend off the cold bite of the morning wind. The beastmen, especially the full-beastmen, were far less affected by the chill temperatures. Their fur or thick hides kept the heat inside well enough. They still kept their heads down, avoiding the gazes of any humans nearby.

“Kelsey, get us a spot in line,” Alma said to the burly man with the horns and hooves of an ox. “Luther and I will make sure this is the right place.”

“M-Me? G-Going inside?”

Alma’s expression softened and she rested a gentle hand on Luther’s arm. “No one is going to hurt you here.”

“B-But…” Luther’s slit pupils shifted to the line outside the stayover. His skin rapidly changed from a deep brown to a pale gray matching the layer of clouds overhead. “The others are waiting outside. Shouldn’t we—”

“Don’t want to waste our time standing in line for scraps off a noble’s table. Imagine how dumb we would feel when they ask us for a bowl and all we’ve got are swords.”

One of Luther’s eyes stayed on the line, the other shifted independently back to Alma. “I-I think we should stay outside. Don’t want to b-bother anyone.”

Kelsey clapped a strong hand on Luther’s shoulder. “I’ll keep an eye on him.”

Alma let out a small sigh. “I’ll be right there. Just going to peek inside and make sure the rumors were right.”

With a heavy nod of his horned head, Kelsey headed to the back of the long line with Luther in tow. Alma watched their backs for a moment before squaring her shoulders. Hands on her head, she made sure her hat was firmly in place. As a half with easily hidden characteristics, some might say that she was lucky. Alma wasn’t so sure. It certainly made brief excursions into otherwise unfriendly areas easier. The main problem came when people inevitably found out she was hiding herself.

Trust tended to snap. Even among those who didn’t hold ill intent toward beastmen, they would regard her with suspicion. Why had she been lying? Trying to get close, deceive them, maybe steal something? Most people, Alma didn’t care about. But it was impossible to strike up a friendship. Some said they understood but they would still put some distance between them in the end.

Despite that, Alma rarely went anywhere without her floppy round cap hiding her ears. She had Luther and Kelsey. Striking up relations with anyone else was unnecessary.

Well, unless they wanted to eat.

Slipping past those in line—who weren’t blocking the main entrance, just standing near it—Alma headed inside the stayover. The line continued inside with those standing about within the warm walls of the building looking far more comfortable than those outside. All were up against one wall, keeping well out of the way of the main floor of the stayover’s tavern. A few tables had been moved aside to make room.

The tables were occupied, most with the hardened sort one might expect from mercenaries who had seen action. Alma recognized White Company’s emblem on several of them. Others wore less familiar pins or insignia. A sword with wings, a compass rose set atop a maze, the profile of a helm with an overlarge plume of feathers coming out the top. Other free companies.

What surprised Alma were the amount of demihumans at the tables. Orcs, mostly. Almost all of them bore the compass rose emblem somewhere on their outfits. Alma was aware that free companies occasionally had competent demihuman members. Rarer were the free companies that hired beastmen.

Not that she would disparage her fellow non-humans but getting a job as a demihuman was leagues easier than getting a job as a beastman.

Alma didn’t understand it. Demihumans and humans were easily distinguishable from one another. No one would mistake an orc for a human or an elf for a gremlin, not even under full armor. Yet, for some reason, demihumans were *typically* more acceptable than beastmen. No one could tell her apart from a human so long as she had a hat or helmet on. As soon as she took off her hat, crude comments about her parents and ancestors cropped up, questioning at what point an animal entered her family tree.

Truthfully, Alma didn’t know her parents and didn’t care to. She had no idea how beastmen came about. Neither did anyone else. Nobody even knew where *humans* came from. Only that they were numerous. That didn’t stop the commentary. Those comments *shouldn’t* have affected her. They *didn’t*. But they did affect her employment opportunities.

Yet, there were a *small* handful of beastmen at the tables as well. *All* the beastmen wore the compass rose symbol.

The rumors were true then. One of the free companies was willing to hire beastmen.

The end of the line stopped just outside one of the doors along the side of the stayover’s main room. As soon as she spotted it, the doors opened up. Three men—humans—emerged with sour faces. Alma knew the types. Heavy build indicating a well-bread position in life but carried themselves with discipline gathered from either a stint in the guard or one of the more militaristic mercenary companies. Probably sons of someone in a position of wealth who had been sent out to get some life experience.

As the door closed behind them and the men headed out of the stayover, Alma heard some noise at her back. Though her ears were hidden, she still had better hearing than most. The clink of coins changing hands was a familiar sound, as were the grumbles of those who lost a bet. She turned slightly, eying some of the orcs and humans around the tables.

“Told you. Those are the kind of people here for fun or profit. Arkk isn’t here for fun.”

“Two served at the garrison with me for a few years. Good men, decent in a fight, decent in bed. Thought they’d take.”

“First of all, Arkk isn’t here to bed his employees. Second, pretty sure he fancies women—exotic women, if you get what I’m saying. Third… Garrison men decent in a fight? How many fights do you all see in the garrison a month? One? And probably in the back of a bar.”

“The Duke’s men are highly trained,” a third person said, butting into the conversation.

“Trained against wooden dummies, I bet. Never see a real fight. Few weeks ago, we went after a group of slavers. Outnumbered us twenty-to-one. Killed a hundred of them, forced the rest to surrender, and only lost one of our own in all that.”

“Twenty-to-one?” Someone scoffed. “Sure.”

“Believe it or not, you want to run with us, you have to handle yourself. Oh, next group going in. What do you think about…”

The orc trailed off. It wasn’t hard to see why. The door opened again and a young human appeared in its entryway. He… didn’t look like much. His black clothes were nice enough—better than what anyone Alma knew would be able to wear—but not so grand as to imply a position of high authority. He had a full head of brown hair and a trim beard wrapping around his mouth. There was something about his eyes that gave Alma pause. The way they snapped back and forth around the room, as if he were scanning for any possible threats. A fairly familiar action. But it was the way he glazed over and *dismissed* everyone present that set Alma on edge. As if this room filled with mercenaries, warriors, and wannabes just wasn’t a threat to him.

Maybe it was that the room had several individuals bearing the same compass maze symbol that he had woven into his suit. Alma hadn’t counted but was fairly confident in saying that they outnumbered all the other groups put together. At least of those inside the building. Add up those waiting in the line outside and the scales would tip. Or maybe he was looking for something specific. A particular threat that nobody present represented.

Either way, his gaze passed over her without pause.

The next group in line started to approach, only to stop as the human held up a hand.

“Sorry about this,” the human said with a casual smile despite his alert eyes, “going to pause here for about twenty minutes. Just have to get some things prepared before we continue. I know it is cold outside for those still standing out there. I’ll order up a round of soup for everyone to warm themselves with before we continue.”

Another human emerged, heading toward the back of the stayover. Probably to arrange for the soup to be sent outside. The first human turned away, closing the door behind him.

Alma looked around, counting the doors on that side of the stayover, and promptly turned and headed back outside. She spotted Kelsey and Luther standing at the end of the line—although another few people had formed up behind them in the short time Alma had been inside—but rather than approach, she simply gave them an affirming nod of her head. This was the place. The rumors were true. But she wanted to know a little more about what they might be getting into before fully committing.

This wouldn’t be the first time someone had shown up with a decent job for beastmen only to turn around and try to sell them off to slavers.

Ducking down the alley, Alma counted the windows until she reached the one the human should be inside. She casually walked past once, discretely peeking inside. The human was accompanied by a few others. An elf, an orc, and someone wearing a thick cloak that hid their features. A beastman? If they were accepted, why hide?

As soon as she finished passing the window, Alma turned and pulled a small knife from inside her cloak. Carefully, cautiously, she wedged it between the window panes and twisted just enough to make a small gap. Taking off her hat, her pointed ears sprung up, letting her hear as best she could

***

“Where did they all come from?” Arkk asked, looking around his advisors with one hand rubbing at his forehead.

Dakka grunted. “Sorry,” she said with a frown.

“You said you talked to a single poker table. And only the Claymore present showed any interest. That doesn’t account for the line stretching halfway down the street!”

“She talked?”

“Possibly,” Arkk said, sinking into his chair at one end of their interview table. Propping his elbows up on the table, he used both hands to rub at his temples. “It’s Edvin. I know it is. This is *not* what I wanted. A few discrete recruits, not half the city. What did he do? Hire out all the town criers?”

Upon realizing that they had scores of people here to sign up for Company Al-Mir, Arkk had quickly spoken with the Cliff’s Edge proprietors and made arrangements to use a private dining room as his impromptu interview room. As it was essentially meant for meetings among mercenaries, it had everything he needed to conduct these interviews. Which, given that he had no idea what he was doing, really only required a table and a few chairs. Maybe a piece of parchment and some ink to take notes.

“I fail to see the problem. Is this not what we wanted?” Vezta asked. “Additional personnel help us achieve our goals.”

“The goals are the problem. Not the recruits. If we were an ordinary mercenary company, I would probably be over the moon with the amount of interest we’ve got. But we aren’t. How am I supposed to tell people that we’re planning on undoing the Calamity, pissing off the Inquisition of the Light at every turn, and that we’re here to kidnap someone from the Duke’s manor?”

“Rescue,” Ilya cut in.

“*Whatever* it is, I doubt the guards will be all that enthused. I’m honestly surprised that Vrox hasn’t stopped by to leer at us. I’m *still* waiting for *that* shoe to drop.”

“Maybe they’ve decided we’re not worth it?” Dakka said, puffing out her chest in pride. “Sent them packing at the fortress. While not *in* the fortress, we are here in *force*. Not to mention we’ve got the purifier with us.”

Arkk nodded slowly. He had been getting the same feeling. It was one thing to stand off and wait for prey to stumble into a trap. But when that prey was skirting around the trap and uprooting the crops, it was time to toss the trap aside and hunt them down. Arkk wasn’t sure if that analogy really applied here. Still, the whole rush to investigate the Cliff Academy had been specifically because he had feared that the inquisitors would try to accost them the moment they learned of Company Al-Mir’s arrival.

Instead, as far as Arkk could tell, they had complete freedom to travel around the city. Nobody had tried to stop them. He had even gone back to the academy for more mundane purposes—learning proper magic was still an aspiration of his even if it had fallen in priority with everything else going on—and nobody had stopped him. His entourage, all those who were attending the actual party, were set to meet with a tailor in a day and a half. Hawkwood had been in and out, discussing various matters when he had free time. Now, this recruitment drive that had *somehow* sprung up was drawing plenty of attention. Even if Vrox had somehow missed his arrival, there was zero chance that Company Al-Mir’s presence in the city wasn’t known.

*Thanks, Edvin.*

And yet, they had been left entirely alone.

It made him think back to his most recent encounter with Vrox. The man, upon realizing that he had lost the one thing that could keep Agnete under control, had called Arkk out. Playing to his sense of responsibility and desire to *not* cause wonton destruction by pointing out that other villages would have been in danger from the purifier’s conflagration. He *knew* that Arkk wasn’t a bad person. Every encounter they had, he was happy to talk. Well, *happy* wasn’t exactly the right word. They hadn’t always been *pleasant* talks but the man hadn’t even tried to arrest or attack him until talking definitively failed.

Aside from a few bits of magic, like the teleportation circles, Arkk didn’t even think he had done anything wrong. Maybe that was enough. But it was Vezta that the inquisitors were really worried about. Maybe they finally had enough proof or assurances that Company Al-Mir, Vezta included, wasn’t on some world-destroying warpath at the behest of beings from beyond the stars.

The thought brought an involuntary shudder over Arkk. He turned slightly, looking at the side of Vezta’s cloak, before standing and moving to the window. His eyes searched over the clouds in the sky. The utterly normal and mundane clouds in the unbroken sky. He let out a long sigh, not sure if he was relieved or disappointed.

“Maybe—” “I’m not sure—”

Arkk cut himself off, looking at Ilya. Both had started speaking at the same time. He nodded to her before looking up to the sky once more.

“I was just going to say,” Ilya said, shifting from one foot to the other. “I was talking with some of the people around here. Trying to learn more about the Duke and my mother. I…” She clenched her fists, eyes looking off to one side. Arkk could see it in the reflection of the window. “I’m not sure… she is being… held. Against her will, that is.”

That sounded painful for her to say. Like each word twisted a knife in her stomach.

“The Duke has an advisor. Lots of them, actually, but one keeps getting mentioned when I ask. An elf with long, silver hair and matching eyes.” She drew in a deep, haggard breath. “I should have known after last time. No. I knew. I just didn’t want… Damn it,” she hissed, slamming her fist down on the table.

The sudden noise made Arkk jump. He wasn’t the only one.

Outside the window, a pointed pair of black, cat-like ears slipped into the corner of his vision. Just for a moment. At first, he thought it was a child in the alley but, leaning a little closer to the panes, he realized someone was listening in on their conversation. The blade in the window, keeping it cracked open just a hair, was evidence enough of that.

Arkk quickly looked away, keeping the person only in his peripheral vision. Not that doing so was necessary, Arkk quickly realized. Their back was to the window. They were listening only, not watching.

Ilya continued, talking about her mother, what she had heard from the people she spoke with, and her worries that Alya just didn’t care about her anymore. Arkk empathized. He really did. But his mind was racing over the revelation of this eavesdropper. What had they said? Anything damning? They were already targets of the inquisitors—it was hard to get more damned than that—but anything else?

The Duke. Kidnapping someone from the Duke’s manor. That was a new revelation. Something the inquisitors wouldn’t be aware of. Was this person reporting to the inquisitors? The Duke? A rival mercenary group? No matter what, that was information that couldn’t get out.

“Vezta,” Arkk said, drawing the servant’s attention. Stepping aside, making sure that he wasn’t in view of the window just in case, he pointed down to the corner and mouthed ‘eavesdropper’. “Zullie is taking a long time in the kitchens. Would you mind heading out and seeing if there are any problems?”

Vezta’s eyes flicked to the window then back to Arkk’s. “Understood,” she said, standing. Moving to the door, she quickly left.

Dakka and Ilya, the only two left in the room, stopped talking. Both stared at the corner. Dakka, though she didn’t have her full armor on, still carried her axe at her hip. Her hand firmly gripped the axe’s haft. Ilya tensed and adjusted her stance, moving as if to pounce out the window should he open it.

Arkk waved them off. Making a smiling gesture in front of his mouth with his thumb and middle finger, he pressed forward as naturally as he could. “I was thinking something similar,” he said. “Upsetting the Duke right now isn’t a good idea. We have… twenty-something orcs, a few gorgon, three spellcasters, and now our latest recruits who will probably abandon us if the Duke decides to send his armies out. While I’m sure the Fortress could weather them simply because of its location and the defensive abilities it offers, doing so would be… unpleasant. We wouldn’t be able to show our faces in any burg and… well, it wouldn’t be a good idea all-around.”

“Then…” Dakka started, eyes still focused on the window. “Then what do you suggest?”

“We go to the party, all smiles. Talk to Alya. If she wants to stay then… sorry, Ilya. We can’t do anything about that.”

Ilya blinked several times, the tension in her shoulders lessening. “If she doesn’t?”

“Then we try to help. Hopefully in a way that doesn’t implicate us. With the alternate fortress a bust, for now, we can’t just pop out of there. We do have our contingency plans already in place but… I would prefer if we avoid any trouble. If Alya needs to get out *immediately*, then we do what we can, of course. If not, then at least she knows that we can hopefully help someday.

“After the party ends, assuming without incident, we head back to the Fortress and proceed with our other plan using Katja’s spellcasters. *That* should get us additional help to better achieve our goals,” Arkk said, speaking vaguely now that he knew that they were being watched. “I’m sorry, but I think that’s the best option we have—”

Motion outside the window made Arkk tense. The cat-eared intruder snapped her head to one side, clearly startled. She tried to get up and run but black tendrils snapped out, stretching across the window.

Undoing the latch, Arkk flung open the window and waved a hand. Vezta’s body wasn’t visible but her tendrils glowed bright yellow with her eyes. She saw him. Vezta stepped over the side of the window, bringing through a squirming werecat. Arkk reached outside in her wake, grabbed the dagger that had fallen to the ground as he looked up and down the empty alley, and then quickly closed the window once again.

Arkk turned around, frowning down. The werecat looked up at Vezta with fear-filled eyes, breathing heavily through her nose. She couldn’t speak. Not with Vezta’s tendril clamped against her mouth. There were some muffled sounds. Screaming? Begging? Pleading?

Arkk let out a sigh. A hardened inquisitor would have been one thing. The woman on the ground, though it looked like she had seen her fair share of combat, was clearly out of her depth. Vezta had her pinned completely, to the point where she couldn’t move more than a toe. A toe that Arkk could see through a hole in a worn boot. Was it a disguise? An outfit designed to go unnoticed? Or…

He had seen others—mostly beastmen—wearing similarly worn attire throughout the day. He wasn’t too thrilled with hiring all these people who might soon become enemies of the Duke’s men through no fault of their own. Still, while he had accepted the initial three Claymores and a handful of other humans, he found it somewhat difficult to turn away people dressed like that.

Arkk stood over the woman, toying with the dagger she had dropped. It wasn’t a particularly good blade. Cheap metal and an uncomfortable haft. Still, he hoped he looked threatening. If her attire was to deceive him…

“You get one chance to answer. Who sent you to spy on us?”

Her eyes tore off Vezta with effort but he wasn’t sure that she even saw him before looking back to the monster pinning her to the floor. Which made sense. The mildly threatening act he had paled in comparison to the starfield behind Vezta’s eyes. Some amount of noise—actual words, presumably—escaped Vezta’s tendril. Nothing intelligible.

“Vezta, I need to hear what she said. If she screams or shouts for help, you can eat her.”

“Arkk!” Ilya snapped, tone displeased. “Just kill her. Don’t… *that*.”

Although the werecat’s eyes flicked to Ilya like she was an angel at her initial admonishment, the rest of what Ilya had to say made the cat ears flatten against the woman’s head. The noises from behind Vezta’s tendril died off and she tried, impotently, to shake her head back and forth.

“Vezta?”

Slowly, the tendril peeled back from the woman’s mouth, leaving a long trail of black slime. Which had to be intentional on Vezta’s part. Playing herself up as the scary monster. The woman *didn’t* scream, though she might have whimpered a bit.

“Who sent you?”

“N-No one.”

“How long were you out there?”

“S-Since you called a pause on the interviews.”

“Why?”

The woman’s eyes flicked from Vezta to Arkk, then to Dakka and Ilya. “Heard you were recruiting. Thought knowing what you were looking for would be an advantage.” She tried to smile. It didn’t work, looking more like a grimace.

Arkk closed his eyes. The stupid recruitment thing.

Dakka started laughing. “Isn’t this for the best?” she said between chuckles. “You prefer recruiting like this, right?”

“Like *what*, exactly?”

Dakka tapped her chest. “Us, the gorgon, Savren, that werecat we rescued from the slavers, Edvin… even Hale and that carpenter were under duress from the inquisitors. Face it, it’s better like this. And you don’t even have to explain about the inquisitors.” Dakka grinned down at the woman on the floor. “Welcome to the club.”

The cat ears flattened even more.

“Don’t. Nothing is decided yet. I…” Arkk sighed. “How *did* you hear about this recruitment?”

“Heard from a friend who heard from—”

“Skip to the end, please.”

“Some human at the Primrose mentioned to his friend that Company Al-Mir was more interested in beastmen and demihumans than humans. They were drunk and he… well, mentioned rather loudly, to the entire tavern, that there was a mercenary company willing to hire beastmen. In fact, he has been going on about it for a few days now…”

“Was this other friend a gremlin?”

“Yes,” the werecat answered quickly, not even needing a moment to think.

Arkk squeezed his eyes shut and drew in a deep breath. He had asked Edvin and Lexa to reach out *quietly*, not announce their recruitment to the whole world. After counting to ten, he let it back out.

“I’m going to do it,” Arkk said. “I’m going to throw him to the wurms.”

## 66 - Recruits and Tea


Arkk looked around the commandeered room of the Cliff’s Edge, eyes meeting with those of the assembled recruits. There were just under forty in total—not including a few he had hired outright earlier in the day before realizing just how many people had shown up. About half were beastmen and a quarter were demihumans with the remainder being humans. Not many. Especially not compared to how many people he had seen throughout the day. It was more than he expected upon arriving at Cliff, however, that number having been less than twenty.

He still wasn’t sure that doing this was the right idea but there were a few advantages. Immediately, it made Company Al-Mir look even more legitimate. Mercenary companies recruited often. Maybe not quite the way he had but similar enough. He knew that from his talks with Hawkwood.

Secondly, as much as Company Al-Mir wasn’t a regular mercenary company, they sure had been doing a good job of acting like it. More boots on the ground meant that larger operations, like handling the slavers, would hopefully be safer and far more achievable even without the heavy hitters like himself, Vezta, or Agnete. They couldn’t be everywhere.

Third, though it wasn’t necessarily an advantage, deciding *against* antagonizing the Duke in the immediate future made it far more palatable to hire people who had less dependence on Fortress Al-Mir. Although Dakka pointed out that he preferred to recruit those under duress, he had decided that it was more like he was willing to recruit those who had nowhere else to go. If they had nowhere else to go, their loyalties felt more firm. Maybe that wasn’t true but it made sense somewhere in his mind.

All the new recruits had to worry about were the inquisitors. Speaking of…

“There are a few things to note before you finish signing up with Company Al-Mir,” Arkk said. It was the same thing he had already told those he already recruited. Part of deciding to wait to hire the rest all at once was purely to save his breath explaining this several dozen times. “Chief among them is that the Inquisition of the Light isn’t too pleased with us. We’ve had a few run-ins with inquisitors. Only one incident turned violent. There may be incidents in the future. If that offends your morals or otherwise sounds too dangerous for you, the door is right over there,” Arkk said, motioning to the back of the room.

He paused and waited a moment, fully expecting at least *one* person to get up and leave. To his surprise, however, nobody did. A few glances passed between some of the assembled crowd but aside from a light cough in the back, nobody even said anything. Arkk wondered what to think about that. The beastmen, he could easily imagine, were a little too desperate for coin to concern themselves too much. The rest? He wasn’t sure about.

He would have to keep an eye on everyone for a time to make sure there were no spies among them.

Shrugging, Arkk carried on. “Company Al-Mir makes use of a magical contract for employees. It primarily offers a method of grabbing my attention. Panic, pain, or deliberate attempts to call me will let me know that you’re in trouble. Might not do a lot of good if I’m on one side of the Duchy and you’re on the other but it can—and has—meant the difference between life or death for some of our employees. As a side effect, you might be able to cast spells where you hadn’t been able to before. That is a facet we’re still experimenting with. If magical contracts sound frightening or unappealing, again, the door.”

This time, someone did stand up. Or flew up. A fairy beat its long, dragonfly-like wings and, without a word, drifted over to the door.

Arkk didn’t know too much about fairies. They were a demihuman race that had, according to legend, once been powerful spellcasters. Then the Calamity struck and magic withered. Unlike many magical species, the fairies didn’t die off. They did lose their magic. They were effectively shorter humans—though taller than gremlins—with insect wings now.

All that made him think that she had been offended at the idea that he could grant people the ability to cast spells. Or maybe she didn’t want to get her hopes up only to find out that she still couldn’t use magic. Either way, Arkk waited for the door to close behind her before looking over the rest of the crowd.

Nineteen beastmen, including three who weren’t allowed to leave, sat on one side of the room. Most had watched the fairy depart with pitying looks, furthering Arkk’s suspicion of the fairy’s reasons. The eleven demihumans—seven orcs, two gremlins, and two dark elves—just shook their heads. The seven humans maintained stiff shoulders and barely paid any attention to the rest. Not out of malice, Arkk hoped, but simply because most of them were more disciplined, having jumped ship from the Order of the Claymores.

Hopefully, there wouldn’t be any problems with that company over his stealing of their members.

“The pay is a gold coin every month. There are bonuses when you see combat and for other work performed. I mentioned this during the interviews but, as a reminder, anyone with skills outside the realm of combat is in high demand. Bonuses in pay are available for blacksmiths, magical researchers, carpenters, tailors, and so on. You can speak with one of us later on.

“As for us… Once again, I am Arkk, leader of Company Al-Mir. Outside of life-or-death situations, we’re fairly casual. Call me Arkk, boss, or whatever else you like. This is Ilya, my second-in-command.”

Ilya gave a curt nod of her head, making sure people knew who he was gesturing toward. She didn’t speak, however, and from years of knowing the elf, he could tell that she was at least a little nervous. Which Arkk found mildly amusing. She charged off with a bunch of raider orcs in tow, rescued slaves on her way back, and interacted with everyone at the fortress without trouble but set her up in front of a crowd and she balks?

Cute.

“Dakka is a primary field commander and who you’ll likely be reporting to in the immediate future.”

The large orc took in a breath, making herself look just a little taller. Her hard eyes looked over the crowd but kept drifting back to the orcs. There *wouldn’t* be any problems with her being the ‘runt’ of Company Al-Mir. Arkk had made sure of that during the interviews. Unless Arkk had misread the situation with the orcs currently employed, Dakka had proved herself worthy of her position. Still, he could understand her nervousness as well.

It was also cute in a way.

“Zullie is the head of magical research. If you do have a background in spellcasting, you’ll want to speak with her.”

“Please don’t,” Zullie said with a tight smile, using her middle finger to adjust the position of the rectangular glasses she wore. “Unless you have five years of study at Cliff Academy or equivalent, have invented your own spells, published books on theoretical magics, or apprenticed to any *well-known* names in the magical community, you’ll be useless in Al-Mir’s research division.”

“So she says,” Arkk said with a smile. “But if you have unorthodox training, you might want to check in with her anyway. She has been surprised by the capabilities of those without a formal education before,” he said, hardening his tone as he shot her a look.

Her tight smile turned to a tight-lipped frown but she nodded, accepting the point.

“Lastly, at least among those present today, Vezta. My adjutant—” He decided to steal Hawkwood’s term for his assistant as he felt it best described what Vezta was to him. “—and the primary caretaker of our headquarters. A quartermaster, in other words. If you have material needs, please ask her.”

At her introduction, Vezta lowered the hood of her heavy cloak. *That* caused a reaction. Not as much of a reaction as *he* had experienced during his first encounter with Vezta. Then again, that time had seen her spreading her mass throughout an entire room with dozens of glowing yellow eyes peering out from the shadows. Here and now, she really did look just like an unusual demihuman.

Alma, one of the recruits who wasn’t allowed to leave, visibly shuddered. The hat on her head hid her ears but small movements in the hat made it look like they flattened down against her head. She did not join in on the low murmuring going on among the rest of the recruits.

“Any questions?” Arkk asked as the noise died down. A few looked about ready to stand up and speak but Arkk headed them off. “Any questions not related to Vezta? It’s just a minor skin condition. Not contagious or harmful to anyone around her. We’d *all* appreciate it if you didn’t make it into a big deal.”

Despite the disbelieving looks passed around, most of those who had been about to speak didn’t. There were still a few questions. Where were the headquarters located? What kind of training was available? How did the contract work? What kind of work did Company Al-Mir specialize in? Several of the questions he had answered during the interviews but not to everyone. Some questions he had to make things up on the spot. Others he answered evasively—mostly any question related to the location of Fortress Al-Mir.

After a time, the questions tapered off. Aside from the fairy who had left, not a single one of those remaining seemed to have any kind of major problem with any of Al-Mir’s various oddities. All of them stuck around until the end.

“Queue up, please. Sign your name on the parchment. If you cannot write or read, Ilya will assist and there may be lessons available in the future. After that, you’ll receive an advance on your payment. A single gold piece.”

Let them think that the paper was the magical contract. It had a lot of text on it and several symbols that wouldn’t do anything, thanks to Zullie. There were a few hesitations in signing it but everyone did so in the end. No one hesitated to take the gold.

“Is this Evestani gold?” asked one of the former Claymores. Joanne, if he remembered correctly. “I don’t recognize it… except this is your company’s heraldry?”

“Company Al-Mir mints its own gold coins. Rest assured, I’ve not run into any problems using them within the Duchy. They typically exchange for between thirty and fifty silvers, depending on how generous the merchants are feeling.”

“Odd. Why not use the King’s stamped coin?”

Arkk shrugged. “This is what I’ve got. In any case, once paid, you’re free to go for now. As mentioned, Company Al-Mir has no official presence in Cliff City. We’re staying in the city for one week and one day for other business, which you all don’t need to be involved in as new recruits. In a week, we’ll meet back here and leave the city, heading westward. We’ll reach Fortress Al-Mir and get you all settled in properly. Enjoy yourselves, don’t spend your payment all at once, and if you need us in the interim, we’ll be here. Just find anyone with the compass maze badge and they’ll find one of us later on if we’re not around.”

“If we…” one of the beastmen started. A younger boy. Glancing down at the paper, Arkk quickly picked his name from the list. Luc. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what kind of beastmen he was, only that he had feathers instead of hair but wasn’t a harpy as he had humanoid hands and no wings. “If we don’t have anywhere else to go, can we stay here?”

Arkk considered a moment then nodded his head. “I believe there are a few bunks free in the room the majority of the employees are staying in. Anyone else wish to stay? I’m willing to rent another room if necessary.”

About two-thirds of those present voiced agreement. Every one of the beastmen plus both dark elves and one of the former Claymores. More than Arkk expected but he wasn’t all that surprised. Knowing how Cliff treated nonhumans, the chance to stay in a fancy stayover or head back to the streets they had lived on before wasn’t that difficult of a choice.

“Alright, I’ll have arrangements made. Everyone else is free to go. Alma, stay behind, I need to explain—”

“Arkk,” Ilya whispered, leaning over with a hand on his shoulder. “We’re going to be late to our other appointment for the day.”

Arkk grimaced then nodded his head. “Right. Alma, *Vezta* will explain a few more things to you now that you’re one of us properly.”

The poor werecat looked like she was going to be sick. “Can I just wait for you to come back?”

“No. She won’t bite.”

“But…” The werecat peered over at Vezta—who had a prismatic smile on her face, completely ignoring the horror of the situation—and let out a shaky sigh. “Okay.”

“Dakka, Ilya, we’re heading out in a few minutes.”

***

Standing in front of a larger manor, one that easily exceeded the Baron of Langleey’s home, Arkk had to frown at the large head of a wolf adorning its front gate. It wasn’t a real wolf but was some metal artwork designed to look like one. The home of Wolf Trading Company’s founder, Aron Wolf.

If Arkk were being perfectly honest with himself, he had completely forgotten about his brief encounter with the man and his daughter out in Darkwood Burg. The same was not true in reverse. Much as Hawkwood had done in sending out his adjutant to invite him to dinner, Aron Wolf had sent out a servant with a similar invitation. Not for a meal, just for a quick chat to catch up.

Arkk wasn’t sure that he had made that large of an impression on the man. Still, the invitation had come and there was probably some good that could come from cultivating relations with a renowned merchant. No sense throwing it away. It could have come at a slightly better time. Although he trusted Vezta and Zullie to see to matters involving the recruits, being there in person would have been ideal, at least for now.

“Ah. Sir and madams, you have arrived.” A lanky man with a bushy white mustache appeared at the gate, hardly using any effort to swing it open. He stepped aside, motioning with one hand over his waist as he offered a respectful bow. “If you would follow me.”

Arkk, smoothing down the front of his black suit, stepped forward. Ilya and Dakka fell in step just behind him.

“Mister Wolf was quite thrilled to hear of your arrival. Although, he did express some disappointment when you neglected to reach out to him.”

“I’ll be sure to apologize,” Arkk said. “It was a busy few days and we just haven’t had the time for social calls yet.”

“Of course. But you made time today. I’m sure Mister Wolf is most appreciative.”

After leading them up a flagstone courtyard, they stepped into an entry hall furnished with polished wood. Several pedestals lined the walls, each bearing a curio of, presumably, high value… though Arkk doubted he would ever be interested in displaying a curled conch or broken sword. Higher on the walls, paintings lined the entry hall. Some were of simple scenery. Others were portraits of people that Arkk didn’t recognize.

Off to one side of the entry hall, the butler brought them to a small lounge. Wood cabinets, decorated with more curios, broke up smooth tan-colored walls. A few life-sized portraits and one large polished mirror filled in the spaces between the cabinets. A fireplace, already lit, warmed the room with an accompanying yellow glow.

At the center of the room, surrounding a small table, two chairs sat across from two larger couches. The chairs were occupied. For a moment, Arkk almost didn’t recognize the people. Arkk wouldn’t have described the Wolf family’s appearance in Darkwood as peasants but they had certainly been wearing cheaper traveling attire. Here and now, a middle-aged man with graying hair, styled with a tasteful touch of grease, puffed on a wooden pipe in a rich velvety-red jacket. At his side, wearing a slim yet elegant white dress, Aron Wolf’s auburn-haired daughter waved an irritated hand in front of her face, trying and failing to dispel some of the smoke.

“Mister Arkk! Welcome, welcome!” Aron Wolf stood, leaving his pipe behind in a tray on the wooden table. When he stepped around the table, hand extended to greet Arkk, his daughter grabbed it and emptied the contents into the fireplace. “Please, join us. Take a seat. Your companions as well. I think I recognize you,” he said to Dakka, “but never had the pleasure of hearing your name.”

Arkk wondered if that was true or if he was just guessing that she was one of the orcs he had with him back during their previous meeting. Dakka wasn’t wearing the armor she had used at Darkwood, but black pants, an underbust corset, and a white shirt with small wooden buttons. Her hair, braided tightly against one side of her head while hanging loose on the other, wasn’t nearly as chaotic as it had been while they had been out traveling in Darkwood. She did have her axe, even now. Slung through a leather loop hanging from her belt, she had to remove it in order to sit on one of the red couches around the table.

“Dakka.”

“Lovely,” Aron said, smiling. “And, speaking of lovely, I’m *sure* I would have remembered someone as beautiful as you, my dear,” he said, turning to Ilya.

Ilya started to roll her eyes. Arkk saw the very moment where she decided that doing so would be a bad idea and forced herself to stop. Instead, she put on a smile and took his offered hand.

“Ilya, Company Al-Mir’s second-in-command,” she said.

He twisted her hand to the side and stooped over, planting a kiss on the back of her glove. While his head was down, Ilya *did* roll her eyes. An action, Arkk noted, which Arianna mirrored.

“The pleasure is all mine,” he said, taking a little longer than necessary to release her hand.

When he finally did, Ilya and Arkk took their seats. Dakka, muscular and large as she was relative to the humans, occupied an entire couch on her own, leaving a single couch for Ilya and Arkk. They were large enough that there should have been plenty of space between them. To Arkk’s surprise, Ilya leaned over toward him, half resting against him as they settled in.

Aron hesitated a moment before smiling and retaking his seat. His hand absently grasped at the tray where he left his pipe but, finding nothing as Arianna still had it, he quickly motioned to the other occupied seat. “Arianna, my daughter, I’m sure you remember.”

“Greetings,” the girl said, tone flat.

Arkk smiled in turn. “She did leave an impression at Darkwood,” he said, prompting a polite laugh from Aron.

“I’d hope so. She’s going to be the face of Wolf Trading Company one day and needs to leave all the impressions she can!”

“Let us not discuss this now, father,” Arianna said, tone stiff. “You invited our guests to talk about them, not me.”

“Now, now. When socializing, you must offer yourself up as much as you ask of the other party. Otherwise, one side ends up feeling awkward. But, you aren’t completely incorrect,” Aron said with a laugh, looking back to Arkk. “When you said you got out to Cliff on occasion, I thought we might see each other sooner than this.”

“I don’t know that I said on occasion… just that I had been now and again.”

“Glad you arrived when you did. We’ll be taking off on business again in about two weeks. Almost missed us. Heading out to a little salt flat in Lockloch to see what we can make of the place. How about you, though? Here on business?”

“Something like that. Company Al-Mir has garnered enough renown for the Duke to take notice. We received an invitation to his next party.”

Arianna made a very vocal “Ugh,” glancing off to one side as she did so.

“Ah. I do recall you mentioning wanting to attend one of those. Next Suun, yes? I’ll be there as well. Arianna… is avoiding this one.”

“Really? Any reason why?”

“The Duke is a pig,” Arianna said in the same flat tone. “Everyone there is scarfing through his scraps. The worst of the worst—”

The smile on Aron’s face vanished in an instant. “Arianna! Please.” He looked back to Arkk, eyes stopping over Dakka and Ilya on the way. His worried expression slowly lessened, likely taking in the expressions on their faces. They were no allies of the Duke.

Ilya especially.

“Well… you shouldn’t let her comments get you down if you’re excited to go. At the very least, the food is excellent. Even Arianna agrees.”

Grudgingly, she gave a curt nod of her head.

“Though, I have to ask… you aren’t attending in… *that*, are you?”

Arkk glanced down at his suit and frowned at Ilya’s casual tunic. “No, no. Of course not. Hawkwood made us an appointment with a tailor. We’re seeing them tomorrow morning, actually, for some quick attire.”

“Tailor?” Aron said, latching onto the safe topic as quickly as he could. “Anyone I know?”

Arkk hesitated, drawing a complete blank. Thankfully, Ilya came to his rescue.

“I believe it was Terrier’s Silken Goods?”

“Oh. Oh no, no, no. That won’t do at all.” Aron shook his head back and forth. Even his daughter nodded along.

“Is that a problem?”

“Not if you want uniforms for a mercenary company, I suppose. Gowns and dresses for a party? Don’t worry. We can still fix this. *Madame Webb’s Fine Threads* is where you’ll want to go. I’ll send a letter explaining the situation. Webb is an old friend of mine. She’ll get you what you need and in half the time. I doubt Terrier would be ready by next Suun. You are cutting it a bit close, though. Next time, it would be best if you made arrangements at least a month in advance.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” Arkk said. If there was a next time.

“Now that business is out of the way. Sebastian! Tea, if you please.” Aron clapped his hands together. The man with the bushy mustache quickly set out cups in front of everyone, including a larger cup for Dakka. “And while we drink, I would love to hear about your adventures. I say, Darkwood was a bit close to the adventures of a mercenary group for my tastes but I can’t deny that it was thrilling! Been up to anything else in the interim? Something impressive to have garnered the attentions of the Duke, no?”

“Well…” Arkk started. “There was a group of slavers…”

## 67 - The Duke's Manor


“I feel like an impostor.”

“We *are* impostors,” Ilya said, fiddling with the sleeves of her dress. She grasped hold of long, dangling strips of cloth. “What are these for? Can’t I cut them off?”

Arkk looked over her. *Madame Webb’s Fine Threads* had come through. Last night, the day before the party, Arkk had received the delivery at the Cliff’s Edge. Clothes for himself, Ilya, Dakka, and Zullie.

Ilya’s dress was a long white gown that hugged her waist and left the tops of her shoulders bare, save for a single white strap on each keeping the dress up. Long sleeves looked relatively normal right up until they reached her wrists, at which point the cloth hung down for almost another arm’s length, drifting loosely in the wind. Down at her feet, her dress spread out over the floor of the carriage, leaving her feet hidden.

“And what’s with the tightness around the knees? I can barely walk.”

“The tailor assured us that this was current fashion,” Arkk said, forcing his eyes back to Ilya’s face. He had been somewhat skeptical as well. The bare shoulders especially. The bare shoulders with *sleeves* extra especially. He couldn’t fault the end result, however. “You look beautiful.”

Ilya glanced aside. Embarrassed? Her expression quickly switched to a flat look that she leveled at Arkk. “Like I can trust *your* opinion.”

“You’ll draw every eye there, I’m sure of it.”

Ilya put up one eyebrow. “Is that a good thing?”

“I… don’t know. I might get a bit jealous if too many good-looking young men approach you.”

Ilya pressed her lips together. He expected some admonishment about how who she interacted with would be her decision. “Frankly,” she said instead, “I don’t think I want *anyone* at one of these parties to approach me. I spoke with that Wolf guy’s daughter once or twice over the week. She had *nothing* good to say about *anything*.”

“If anyone bothers you, we can handle it. Though let’s try to avoid making too big of a scene.”

“And if the Duke bothers me?”

Arkk’s teeth clenched together, unable to keep his irritation at the *thought* from his face. “We’re not peasants. We have status and renown. He can’t just… steal you away.”

“If he does?”

“Then we switch to Plan D,” Arkk said, voice hard.

Ilya stiffened then, slowly, smiled as she nodded to herself. It was a small thing. A shy smile that made Arkk’s heart calm.

“What if he comes after me, boss?”

Arkk turned, pulling his eyes away from Ilya. He had *almost* forgotten that there were others in the carriage with them.

Dakka sat across from him, leaning against a wooden panel next to the carriage door. Bare shoulders were surprising on Ilya. Arkk wasn’t quite sure what to think about Dakka’s dress. Madame Webb had never designed for an orc before and, given the short notice with which they needed attire, had instead cobbled together a few different pieces that she had lying about. Madame Webb had *claimed* that she wished to show off the orc physique with her creation. Arkk was fairly certain that she simply didn’t have the time to sew together enough cloth.

The end result was bare arms and a bare midriff. Dark blue cloth, sprinkled with lighter blue highlights woven into the fabric, criss-crossed over Dakka’s chest, looping around her neck and the middle of her back. A light gray sash looped around her waist, underneath which long strips of the same blue cloth hung down to her ankles. Part of the lower dress was split, letting her walk a whole lot easier than Ilya while showing off one of her legs.

Dakka didn’t look bad. Quite the opposite. It was strange and unusual attire. If he didn’t know better, he wouldn’t have been surprised if Dakka said that she came from some far-off kingdom where the weather was always warm. He was sure that the wealthy and elite would balk at the multitude of scars adorning her tan skin but Arkk thought they added a bit of character. They and her impressive muscles showed off that she was a warrior.

Arkk had thought she might balk at the dress. He had been right, though for the wrong reasons. Her main issue wasn’t in the attire itself but rather the lack of weapons at her side.

“Stare too much and the elf will get jealous,” Dakka said with a grin. Confident in her tone yet he could see the way her hand hovered where her axe should have been.

Ilya scoffed. “Hardly.”

“Oh? I saw you watching Arkk just now, looking for his reaction to me.”

“You misunderstand. I watched in the hopes that you would take this love-struck fool off my—”

“If you people are done with your primitive mating rituals,” Zullie cut in, looking irritated as she adjusted her glasses. “We’re crossing the drawbridge to the Duke’s Manor now.”

Zullie wore something more akin to Ilya’s dress. Bare shoulders—though her black dress had three sets of straps over each shoulder, one vertical, one at an angle, and the last parallel to the ground. A crescent moon cutout on the front of her chest had some semi-transparent sheer cloth over the top. The same material adorned her waist, loose as it draped down to the floor. Some thicker cloth underneath covered her legs. Rather than sleeves, she wore long black gloves that stretched up above her elbows.

“You look good too, Zullie,” Arkk said with a smaller smile.

The woman just scoffed. “I can’t believe I’m here. I would rather be back at the stayover, reading through the books we stole. *Ugh*. I can’t believe Savren was right about the counter-clockwise magic collision problem. Where did he even learn about that? But I was right about the anti-magic seepage barrier. Planar magic is far more chaotic than *mind*—”

“Should we be talking about that *here*?” Ilya asked, looking around with obvious discomfort. As if someone might hear them talking.

Technically, their coachman wasn’t part of Company Al-Mir. Rather, someone in Hawkwood’s employ whom he had hired to take them to the manor. But the carriage was fully enclosed. Unless they raised their voices, they shouldn’t be heard that easily.

Despite Ilya’s concerns, Arkk leaned forward, interested. “Katja can provide ten spellcasters. With what you know now, is that enough? Do we need to find a few more?”

“That should be enough. The ritual should only need minor alterations at this point. I’ll know more once I get back and can do some proper calculations.”

“Good,” Arkk said, sitting back. As he did so, he felt something else move at his side.

The other member of their group had been leaning forward as well.

“Excited?”

Vezta hummed. She was the only one in the carriage who did not have fanciful attire on. She didn’t even have her heavy cloak. Vezta sat in her usual body, white and dark violet in parts that gave off the impression of clothing. A multitude of her golden eyes swiveled in their starfields to focus on him. “Breaching the Calamity and reaching the Underworld will be a great step toward undoing the Calamity in its entirety. I’m surprised at how close that task feels after a thousand years of stagnation.”

“I’m surprised you sat around in the fortress for a thousand years.”

“I could not leave the Heart,” she said simply, not using the [CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE] for perhaps the first time. Arkk had specifically asked her not to do anything that might draw extra attention to them. While employees of Fortress Al-Mir seemed fine with hearing the language, anyone else got headaches, stabbing pains, or just feelings of deep discomfort. “The Heart is my responsibility. Abandoning that to languish without a master, even temporarily, would have been a severe dereliction of my duties.”

“Even if you would have been able to find a new master sooner?”

“You came eventually. My patience was rewarded. I need no other Master.”

Arkk stared a moment, eyes lingering in Vezta’s burning suns. After a short moment, he nodded his head. “Well, I can’t say I’m upset that someone else didn’t steal the opportunity from me. Hopefully, I’m living up to your expectations.”

“Moving from a peasant to a proper Keeper of a Heart isn’t a simple jump. You are performing most adequately.”

“That’s good. I—”

Arkk cut himself off as he felt their carriage come to a stop. Looking away from Vezta, he gazed past Ilya and out the window of their carriage. Even though night had fallen, the Duke’s Manor was lit up to the point where he might have been confused about the time of day. Statues of lions flanked the entrance while rows of guards wearing gleaming silver armor stood up and down the path to the main entrance.

“Vezta,” Arkk said. The servant nodded and ripped herself into his shadow without a word. He looked to the other three. “Remember, if you need help, you can call to me. I’ll find you as fast as I can. Or Vezta will if the situation is dire enough. Hopefully, we won’t need that, though. Let’s just try to have some fun, talk to Alya, and get out of here in one piece.”

Their coachman, after tapping his knuckles against the door as a warning, pulled open the doors.

Ilya stepped out first. For the first time *ever*, Arkk watched as her natural grace failed her and she *almost* stumbled out of the carriage because of the tight dress around her knees. Arkk caught her by the arm, keeping her from falling outright. The coachman promptly mumbled an apology and held out a hand to help her out.

Arkk moved next, accepting the coachman’s help but not needing it. His attire wasn’t that difficult to move in.

He wore a light brown jacket over a white, ruffled shirt. The jacket wasn’t closed or buttoned together. A thin pair of varnished leather bands kept it from fluttering open in the chill breeze but it was otherwise open to display the fancy shirt underneath. Intricate designs were woven into the jacket up and down the edges and a white cloth poked out of a breast pocket. His trousers were far simpler than any of the dresses, barely being anything different than what he might normally wear except in terms of how fine the cloth was.

The coachman didn’t help Dakka out of the carriage. Arkk offered his arm instead. She placed a hand on his arm but didn’t put any weight on him, not needing the help to get out. Zullie, the last one out, scowled at the coachman and then at Arkk before hopping out on her own.

“Try to smile,” Arkk said, forcing his face into a casually pleased look.

“I’d rather be back at the stayover.”

“Yes. You said that. Just imagine what kind of magical protections the manor has. Doesn’t that sound interesting? Maybe you can get a tour of that tower,” Arkk said with a wink.

Zullie just scoffed. “More interesting than planar—”

“Ilya’s right. No talking about work while we’re here.”

Her violet eyes glowered behind her rectangular glasses.

Arkk just forced himself to smile a little more.

“Sir. Ladies,” a newcomer said, dressed in fine attire yet nothing flashing. One of the manor’s servants. “If you would be so kind as to follow me.”

Leaving the coach behind, Arkk walked alongside Ilya with Dakka and Zullie a step behind. He had to frown as they passed the guards outside the entrance. It was a soft noise but he could hear metal rattling. Given the cold air, he had to imagine they were shivering something fierce inside their armor. Even with a thick gambeson under their armor, being made to stand around in the cold as they were was a fairly cruel posting. Had they upset a superior to be assigned here or did they draw straws? Whatever the case, they surely could have performed guard duty from a slightly warmer locale.

They were here to show off. Their gleaming, polished armor was evidence enough of that.

Arkk wasn’t wearing as much as he would have liked either. Hawkwood, Wolf, and even Madame Webb had all said that it would be warm inside, however, so he just steeled himself until a pair of guards pulled open overlarge doors, admitting them into the manor proper.

And what a manor it was. In his travels, he had seen a few keeps and manors for the various barons that ran the Duchy. He hadn’t been inside too many of them. Just the Moonshine Burg keep while reporting on his efforts against the slavers and Edvin’s former crew. Most were fairly modest affairs, even the large keeps. The smaller village barons had small homes with only a few rooms. Maybe a second floor or maybe not.

The entryway alone to this manor could have held three stories. A mural adorned the high, vaulted ceiling depicting a cloudy sky with a few figures engaged in revelry. A dozen men poured what he had to assume was fine wine into each other’s glasses, toasting the skies and feasting on a lavish spread of meats and fruits. Magical rituals had been carved into the stone columns holding up the ceiling, providing enough illumination to see everything. Enough illumination that the large shadow underneath his feet should probably have been a lot smaller. People didn’t notice that sort of thing, luckily.

While there were a few others, guests judging by their attire, standing about the large room, the valet led them through to the large glass-roofed ballroom just off the main entrance. Although lit in the same way, Arkk felt like the mural was a bit more impressive than the glass. Perhaps a bit too gaudy though. A bit too on-the-nose with regards to the Duke’s greedy taxes. In that respect, Arkk preferred the peaked glass.

They came to a stop just inside the ballroom. One well-dressed valet swiftly approached and held out a hand. “Invitations, please?”

Arkk tried not to look nervous as the moment of truth arrived. Would Edvin’s forgeries be enough? They had passed Hawkwood’s examinations but there was always the chance that these people were trained to spot such forgeries. Reaching into his jacket, Arkk withdrew the folded piece of paper.

The valet skimmed over it with half-lidded eyes before turning to the room at large. “Company Al-Mir has arrived,” he announced.

And then he walked back to his post. No one came to stop them. No one looked twice at the unfamiliar announcement. In fact, of the packed room—there had to be at least two hundred people present if not more—only those closest to the door looked over at the announcement and they all quickly went back to what they were doing.

People mingled about, all wearing attire roughly in the same vein as theirs. Tables were set out along the sides of the room but the central area was left free for people to stand. Off to one side, atop a small wooden platform, a few minstrels provided music using windpipes and stringed instruments. They played quietly enough that conversations wouldn’t be disrupted but loud enough that awkward silences wouldn’t be completely silent. A set of stairs at the far end of the room led to a dais with a statue set on top. It wasn’t the Duke, which Arkk would have expected of the man, but rather something that looked vaguely similar to the statues in Fortress Al-Mir’s temple room.

It was a tall man with a strong jaw and a mask hiding his upper face, holding onto a spear in one hand and a staff in the other. A long cape made from brass spread out behind him while a golden heart-shaped emblem stood proud on his armor. A sort of mixture of the three statues Vezta had pointed out as traitors.

Arkk wasn’t quite sure what that meant. Vezta noticed, though he wasn’t quite sure how as he couldn’t see any eyes in his shadow. Still, he saw the way the edges of the shadow twisted and churned in agitation.

“It will be alright,” Arkk said softly, stepping further into the room. He didn’t want to block the entrance if there were more guests on their way. More importantly, he didn’t want to stand around gawking like a peasant. Although he had no fondness for the Duke, some of the people present could be valuable contacts for information or even goods that Fortress Al-Mir couldn’t produce.

Ilya, tall at his side, scanned the room from one end to the other. “I don’t see Mother.”

Arkk looked around and frowned. Most of the attendees were human, as he expected. A few weren’t. There was a scattering of elves throughout the room that looked dressed in a way that Arkk would presume meant they were guests. However, there were several nonhumans mixed into the crowd. Some danced on their own, separate from the guests, while others carried around small trays of food and drink. A few, Arkk noted with his frown deepening further, weren’t dressed too dissimilarly to Dakka.

If Madame Webb thought that Dakka was entertainment rather than a proper member of their team, she wouldn’t be receiving his business again in the future.

“It’s the start of what I am sure is going to be a long night,” Arkk said, whispering as he took a flute of amber liquid from a passing dark elf. Elves and orcs stood out easily because of their height. He didn’t see Alya either. “I’m sure there will be time to find her. If it is getting toward the end of the night and still no sign of her… we’ll see what we can do.”

Ilya opened her mouth but didn’t get to speak before a boisterous voice called out. “Arkk! You made it.”

Hawkwood approached with a bright smile. He looked much better than he had the last time Arkk saw the man. There were still hints of fatigue around his eyes. Arkk wasn’t sure if he was faking his enthusiasm or if he had genuinely gotten some rest recently. Either way, Arkk put on a smile of his own.

“Hawkwood.”

“Come, come. We’ve some time before the meal begins. Would you like an introduction to some of the other mercenary leaders around?”

“I think that would be excellent,” Arkk said, looking back to the others.

Dakka was standing a little closer to him than he might have expected, looking like a bodyguard despite her attire. It was her eyes and the way they scanned the room. Not for familiar faces as Ilya had done. Rather, she was on the lookout for threats. Her fingers kept close to her side where she normally kept her axe.

Zullie, on the other hand, had drifted away and was frowning up at one of the supporting pillars, eyes looking over the ritual circle inscribed in its side. Arkk didn’t see anything special about the magic used for lighting—he was educated enough to recognize it for what it was now—but perhaps she noticed something he had missed?

“I’d like to look around for a minute,” Ilya said, taking a step away from Arkk.

Arkk held out a hand, lightly touching her elbow. “Careful,” he whispered. “Remember, if you get in trouble and need help—”

“I know, I know. I’m not going to do anything. Just see who I can talk to around here. Maybe some of the other elves.”

Arkk nodded and turned back to Hawkwood with a smile. “Well then, I suppose it is just Dakka and myself.”

“Wonderful. I must say, you’ve been garnering some notoriety,” Hawkwood said, walking away while half turned to speak to Arkk. “The current commander of the Order of the Claymores has been asking about you.”

“Uh oh.”

“Hm?”

“I… uh… might have poached a few of her people.”

Hawkwood’s grin spread wider. He gave Arkk a hearty clap on his back. “Don’t worry. Happens all the time. It’ll be fine. No one is here to be enemies.”

“If you say so,” Arkk said, not so sure at all about the truth of that statement.

He was still waiting for the inquisitors to drop down on his head. They or the Duke… Or even Alya herself.

There was a lot that could go wrong. He just had to smile and hope for the best.

While planning for the worst.

## 68 - The Party, Interrupted


For all the negativity he had heard with regard to these monthly parties and his own biases against the Duke, Arkk couldn’t say that the party was *bad*. Strange and alien, yes. Social rituals were being conducted all around him, ones he didn’t quite understand nor could he participate in.

Arkk, lead through the ballroom first by Hawkwood and then by Aron Wolf, bounced from group to group. He barely had time to talk to any of them before being whisked off to be introduced to the next little clique. Zullie, Ilya, and even Dakka were nowhere to be seen. None had alerted him to any problems…

If he were being honest, he wished one of them *would* have a problem just so that he could disentangle himself from smiling at some old man who was droning on about how well the glassblowing industry had faired this year. Arkk kept up a polite smile, not sure what to say or do. Aron occasionally interjected with his commentary on whatever business ventures he had entered into recently, mostly discussing his plans for Darkwood come spring.

At its base, the party was a festive feast. Not altogether unlike a good meal after a bountiful harvest back at Langleey. Yet the whole affair was so… *subdued*. People stood around, talking and making business deals rather than celebrating. This wasn’t exactly a celebration so maybe that was understandable. Still, it just felt off to Arkk. Then there was the food and drink. People drank but not like at a proper feast. They sipped at tall glasses, metering and measuring how much they consumed. The food was slightly less surprising, if only thanks to Hawkwood’s invitation to dinner upon Arkk’s arrival to Cliff. It consisted of a dozen plates of what was effectively samplings of a proper meal, though, as of yet, that proper meal had yet to be served.

“Ah!” Aron said, interrupting his own words. He reached out and patted the old glassblower on the arm. “I’ve spotted Geralt. I simply have to speak with him this evening.” He paused and glanced toward Arkk. “Head of a woodworking guild who I’m hoping to court to produce end products,” he explained. “Care to meet him?”

“That’s… very kind of you,” Arkk said, trying to avoid looking like he was searching for an escape while still looking for one. If he were being honest, he very much wished that he was still being led around by Hawkwood. At least the man’s mercenary contacts were more… interesting than hearing about trade commissions all evening.

Thankfully and luckily with perfect timing, someone in the room screamed. A sharp note of surprise, not pain. An instant later, blinding white light reflected off the slanted panes of glass overhead, making Arkk blink for a moment before an entire corner of the room went dark.

“But I should see what this is all about,” he said, moving quickly before Aron had time to protest. It helped that the man—and the other businessmen in this group—were looking around with obvious shock and surprise, trying to figure out if something dangerous was going on.

Arkk wasn’t concerned. At least not that the party was under attack. Weaving through pockets of people, he made it to the end of the room just after a small contingent of guards. Judging by the looks on their faces, the guards hadn’t expected anything to go amiss. They probably worked at a ton of these events, all of which went smoothly. Of course, all those events hadn’t had Zullie in attendance.

“—flimsy filigree! It is no fault of mine that the Duke’s contractors couldn’t build the ritual array to last! I was just looking! I didn’t even touch it.”

“—staring at it all night! I watched her walk around the column no less than eight times.”

“—tried to make it look like she slipped but she did something when she touched it. There was a flash. I saw it! Everyone saw it!”

A small crowd stood around in the darkened corner of the room, all talking at once. The poor guards were looking back and forth, trying to sort out the stories. It was clear that none of the guards were leader-types as none had taken charge. Figuring it was best to get in before things could degrade, Arkk started forward and froze.

A tall man broke the barrier formed by the crowd before Arkk could. Hands clasped behind his back and wearing an empty smile, Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox reached the pillar in just a few quick strides of his long legs.

“Zullie, Zullie, Zullie. How *lovely* to see you again.”

A change rippled over the crowd. If these people didn’t know who Vrox was, the gleaming silver pin of an eye with a bar through it told them enough. Many onlookers turned, not-so-subtly edging away from the area. If an inquisitor was involved, they didn’t want to look like they might have had anything to do with the problem. Even the guards, while immediately deferring to the inquisitor, shuffled in obvious discomfort.

Arkk, for his part, remained in the wings, watching to see how the situation played out. If Zullie looked like she was in trouble, he would jump in without hesitation. Until that moment, however, he wanted a better read on the situation. This was the first they had seen of the inquisitors. It had gotten to the point where Arkk figured they just didn’t care. Vrox knew that Zullie worked with Arkk and, by extension, the ‘being from beyond the stars’ as well. Zullie had even fought against Vrox during the invasion of the false fortress, though she hadn’t played a very focal role.

How Vrox interacted with Zullie would tell Arkk a great deal about how the inquisitor might treat him. Would a fight break out right here in the middle of the party? Would Vrox act cordial as he had their first few encounters? Was he upset and holding a grudge? Was it just business?

“Darius,” Zullie said, tone cool and with a note of familiarity. “Finally decided to crawl out from under your church to harass a respectable researcher more intelligent than yourself again?”

“I would never describe you as any of those three words,” Vrox said, tightening his smile ever so slightly. His eyes flicked up to the top of the pillar, which, Arkk noted, was leaking a bit of smoke. Thankfully, the glass ceiling had panels that could be opened. The room wasn’t filling up. “You overloaded the array. Beginner’s mistake."

“If someone had designed a proper shunt, it wouldn’t have been possible to overload. Not that I did. I was just looking when the cycling magic overloaded itself.”

“Ah yes. Spontaneous overload. One of your earlier research projects. You wrote a paper on the subject that almost got you laughed out of the academy. A way of excusing your mistakes in array construction, so claimed your peers, with no factual basis in reality. Haven’t heard a word about it in the years since.”

“The *context* of those essays was overlooked,” Zullie snapped, stomping her foot. “Spontaneous overload only occurs in planar arrays that fail to compensate. Not *regular* ritual circles. Everyone ignored that bit… And I didn’t shut up about it because my ‘peers’ mocked me.” She used her fingers to accentuate the comment. “I dropped the research because *you* came knocking at my door.”

“I recall that conversation. Early in my career, I was a little more generous. Shouldn’t have let you go free, should I have?”

Zullie shifted, looking a little less confident. She adjusted her glasses in a way that Arkk had come to understand meant uncertainty. “I appreciated it,” she hedged.

“Well—”

“Darius Vrox,” Arkk said, deciding to not let his employee suffer any other threats to her life. “How good to see you again.”

“Arkk,” the man said, turning. His circular glasses slid down his nose as he looked down from his height. “I heard you were in town,” he added, tone as flat as Arkk’s.

“I’m hurt you didn’t come visit. I was expecting you from the very first day and you never showed.”

“*That*, Arkk, is exactly why I didn’t come. You’re one of those types who isn’t as clever as you *think* you are. The difference between you and *those* incompetents is that you have a frankly absurd degree of luck to fall back on,” Vrox said. His smile slipped during the latter part of his comment. Taking a breath, he let it out as a long sigh before smiling once again.

“I try,” Arkk said. “I think I’m getting better.”

“That concerns me.” Vrox cast a glance around the room. “You didn’t bring the purifier with you?”

“Agnete said that she isn’t interested in these kinds of things. Even if she was…”

“You wouldn’t want to put all these people in danger,” Vrox finished, nodding his head.

“I didn’t say that.”

“You didn’t need to. I know the purifier. Though not as well as I had thought. I honestly expected you to slip up and leave the Binding Agent aside, opening yourself to incineration. I suppose that was too much to hope for.”

“She isn’t that bad.”

Vrox hummed a note of disagreement.

“So,” Arkk said, eyes flicking down to his shadow just to confirm that it stretched a little too long. With the column in front of him darkened and the rest of the room lit, it reached clear across the space to Vrox. “What now? Fight? Try to arrest us?”

“Unless you’ve come with war in mind, not today, Arkk. Hardly a suitable location for it here, is it? No. I’ve studied your movements and actions for the past several months. You aren’t the type to place unrelated people in danger. I am not either.” He shook his head, looking mildly upset despite his words. 

“You sent random people searching through the Cursed Forest.”

“And none were harmed,” Vrox said with the *worst* smile. Like he knew that there had been no danger in the first place. He was right. It still irritated Arkk. “Arresting you would be within the realm of reasonable action. If I thought it would work. I do not believe you would have come *here* without *some* trickery or foolhardy plan on how you might extricate yourself.”

At that, Arkk dipped his head in acknowledgment. That one was true and Arkk didn’t mind admitting it if it was a factor in *not* trying to arrest him. “So what then? Smile and wave and go our separate waves?”

“It isn’t too late to avoid all conflict. Have you given any further thought to our last discussion?”

Arkk blinked, taking a moment to remember. His first thoughts were of the invasion of the fortress. Aside from panicking over an unleashed Agnete, they hadn’t talked about much during that fight. The last *discussion* had taken place in Langleey just after he sent Hale and John off to the fortress to keep them out of the inquisitor’s hands.

“About handing over my companions?” Arkk asked with narrowed eyes. “I haven’t spared a single second thinking over such nonsense.”

“Shame.” Vrox’s eyes flicked up and over Arkk’s shoulder. Arkk didn’t turn. Although he couldn’t see any eyes lighting up his shadow, he trusted Vezta to have at least some awareness of their surroundings. If someone was sneaking up on him, she would react. “Very well, Arkk. I trust you to not cause issues tonight.”

Trust. An odd way to put it. Arkk doubted he would have trusted Vrox if the man were wandering around Fortress Al-Mir during a party. Nevertheless, Vrox clasped his hands behind his back once again and started away. The guards watched him go, still unsure about what to do with the situation. They had been hoping the inquisitor would definitively resolve it and he clearly had not.

Arkk took advantage of their uncertainty, rushing forward and taking Zullie by the arm. “What were you doing?” he whispered, trying to lead her away. “Blowing up their lights like that?”

“I *didn’t*. I was just looking. There is something unusual about the lights here. The light isn’t generated normally and it isn’t emitted as a byproduct like what happens with a flame. It is… *siphoned* from somewhere. *Planar magic*. Right in the open and on full display.”

Arkk stopped short, glancing back. He had *thought* he understood the array when he saw it. Granted, he had only looked briefly before his attentions were stolen away by the rest of the party. His studies hadn’t reached a point where he had started learning anything about planar magic, unfortunately. He only knew how to draw out teleportation circles from rote memorization, not from any actual knowledge of the subject.

“You’re sure?”

“It is subtle,” Zullie admitted. “But it is there.”

“Where is the light coming from?”

Zullie shrugged. “That’s what I was trying to figure out. Could be the other side of the world where the sun is still up. Could be… *elsewhere*.”

“Is it dangerous?”

“How am I supposed to know that? I don’t even know where it is coming from. Unless it is brand new, other parties have been held here and nobody has—”

“*What* is the meaning of this?” a deep voice bellowed in anger.

Arkk hid the grimace that appeared on his face as fast as it came. He wished for a moment that he hadn’t stopped to look back at the column. It was a silly wish. The guards wouldn’t have taken any time to track him down if he stayed at the party.

Now, he had to deal with the main man.

Arkk had never before met—or even seen—the Duke Levi Woldair. That didn’t mean he didn’t recognize the man before him instantly. He had heard from Ilya, from Aron Wolf, and from Hawkwood what the man was like and how he looked.

With bloated cheeks, a round belly, and eyes a smidge too large for his face, the man looked like a toad. A toad dressed in a flashy red and black suit with thick lapels. Golden thread adorned the hems of his suit jacket, the legs of his pants, and even the ruffled ascot tucked down his front. More gold bands wrapped around each of the man’s thick fingers. Enough to buy a small room back at Fortress Al-Mir.

But Arkk’s eyes lingered on the red-faced man for only a moment. The figure behind him, standing tall with an uncomfortably familiar ethereal grace, stole his attention. Her long hair flowed behind her, draped over her bare shoulders above her light gray dress. There was no doubt about her identity. If there had been, the way her sharp silver eyes flicked over Arkk, Zullie, and the pillar would have removed any uncertainty. It was the same look Arkk had seen a million times while Ilya was out tracking down game.

Although, when she looked at him, Arkk failed to see any familiar recognition in Alya’s eyes. He supposed that made sense. It had been fifteen years since she last saw him. He had been a boy. A peasant at that, off in some backwater village that most of the Kingdom had likely never heard about. Now, he wore fine clothes and stood with dignity among those who would have passed him by with an upturned nose before.

Hopefully, the back of his neck wasn’t quite so sun-worn now.

“Duke Woldair,” Arkk started, forcing his eyes off Alya before she realized how much he was staring. “Pleasure to finally make—”

“Enough,” the man interrupted, face turning shades of purple that couldn’t be healthy. “What happened?” he said through grit teeth. It wasn’t too surprising given what Arkk knew about the man. He valued appearances and wealth. Having a whole corner of his ballroom plunged into darkness with smoke billowing out from the skylight wasn’t the best look.

And Arkk didn’t quite know how to answer him. So he looked to Zullie.

The witch rolled her eyes before donning the fakest smile Arkk had ever seen. “I’m a magical researcher with Company Al-Mir. While enjoying your fine festivities, I started hearing a fizzling noise. A sure sound of improperly vented magical circles. Following my ears, I found the source to be the lighting ritual here,” she said, motioning back toward the pillar. “I began a cursory examination. Following the Keppler array and applying Ragnold’s transvector theorem, I deduced the problem as a violation of Leibniz archaeo-ingnem horaspace directional slipstream. Unfortunately, before I could figure out a way to properly vent the system of excess magical energy… well…” Zullie glanced up, looking and sounding genuinely sorry.

Arkk just stared at her. He had only been *properly* studying magic for a few months now and only between all his other tasks. Still, he was fairly certain that he should have heard of at least *one* of those things she mentioned. He hadn’t. Had she made it all up? Arkk honestly could not tell.

At least the Duke looked less angry and more confused. He clearly had even less of a background in magical studies than Arkk did. “This room was built in my grandfather’s time and has never had a problem.”

“Not surprising,” Zullie answered instantly. “An issue like this is only apparent if the one activating the array has a drastically above-average capacity for magic. Fairly rare. Was someone new in charge of turning on the lights this evening?”

Woldair shared a look with Alya. It was clear that neither knew. Arkk doubted that the Duke involved himself in what was likely the duties of the lowest servants. Arkk wasn’t exactly sure what role Alya played. From what he had heard, she had served as some kind of advisor for the last five years or so. Managing servants was probably not among her duties either.

After frowning up at the thin layer of smoke that wasn’t quite venting out the open windows fast enough, the Duke looked back to the main entrance and made a swift motion with his hand. One of the finely dressed men announcing incoming guests hurried over.

“Majordomo,” the Duke said, sounding far more reasonable now that he wasn’t apoplectic. “Have tables set up in the throne room. Have the guests head to the entrance hall for the time being. We can’t carry on here.”

The servant nodded without a word, turned, and made a few hand motions of his own that gathered a few other servants to his side. They quickly left, departing the room while others began ushering the guests out. Arkk noted Dakka among the first few out the door, talking with what was likely the only other orc in the room.

“Company Al-Mir, you said? I appreciate your efforts at preventing this, even if they failed,” the Duke said, clearly skeptical still. Perhaps he just didn’t want to make more of a scene. “I’ve heard of you. Got the mines of Silver City running again?”

“Yes sir,” Arkk said, hoping his smile didn’t look too forced. Being recognized startled him somewhat. Given that their invitation had been forged, this was the moment when everything might crash down around them.

“A good metal,” the Duke said, nodding his head. Or maybe not. As with the lighting arrangements, the Duke didn’t send out invitations himself. “Not my favorite. It tarnishes too quickly.”

Arkk just kept his smile, not sure what to say to that. Eyes flicking down to the rings on the Duke’s fingers, he had a feeling he knew what metal was his favorite.

“I heard you turned down the reward.”

“The city looked like it needed all the help it could get. Taking what little they had wouldn’t have helped.”

“A man should be entitled to the fruits of his efforts,” the Duke said.

“In that, we agree completely,” Arkk said, trying to keep anything unpleasant out of his voice. Hoping he hadn’t slipped up, he quickly added on, “It was really no effort at all. I just asked the gorgon to move somewhere a little less disruptive.”

“If that was all,” the Duke said, relaxing even more than before. He stepped forward with a smile slowly forming on his face, making him look even more like a toad. “I can’t say I’m upset that you didn’t take my silver.”

Arkk’s eyebrow twitched as Woldair laughed and clapped a hand on his arm.

“That isn’t the first reward you turned down for a job well done if I remember right. Keep that up and you’ll go far indeed. Some of these mercenaries are greedy beyond belief.”

Arkk doubted *any* mercenary company *could* turn down rewards while still paying their men. Fortress Al-Mir was a bit special in that regard.

“Arkk was it?”

“Yes sir. Leader of Company Al-Mir. This is Zullie, my chief magical researcher. My field commander, Dakka, just got swept out into the hall with some of the other guests.” Arkk paused, turning slightly. “My second in command is standing just over there.”

Through his employee link, Arkk could see exactly where Ilya was and the conflicted, hesitant expression on her face as she watched the goings on.

The Duke turned to follow his gaze. Alya did as well. The Duke’s eyes took on a far more disgusting look as he mumbled something about “A man after my own heart.” Arkk had *nothing* polite to say about that and kept his mouth firmly shut.

Alya, on the other hand, drew in a sharp breath of air. She hadn’t reacted upon seeing him or even hearing his name. If the Duke knew this much about him, she had probably heard it before. It was very likely that she hadn’t thought he was the same Arkk that she had helped raise for a little under a decade. Arkk doubted he was the only one with his name in the whole Duchy let alone the greater Kingdom.

Seeing Ilya standing off to the side, however, dispelled any notions that he was someone else. She placed a hand on her chest, wrinkling her dress as she stared at Ilya. Through obvious force of will, she managed to look back to Arkk with renewed interest, looking him up and down with nostalgia in her eyes.

“Arkk?”

“Ah,” the Duke started before Arkk could say a word. “My vizier, Alya.”

“Yes. I’ve… heard of her. Though she is nothing like I imagined.” Namely, a slave chained to a dungeon wall, not someone high in the Duke’s confidence.

“Exotic and beautiful,” the Duke said, nodding his head in total agreement with nothing Arkk meant. “I have a taste for good… *people*,” he added with a wink.

“People…” Arkk said with an ill feeling in his stomach. He shook his head and smiled once again. “Does she ever write home to her family?”

Woldair propped an eyebrow up, not quite understanding. Alya, on the other hand, narrowed her eyes.

“Ilya, my second in command over there, worries a lot about her family. She frets and fears the worst. Just a few months ago, she made her way back home only to find out that the place had been raided by slavers. The poor woman was beside herself, thinking her entire family were slaves, sold off to the most deplorable sorts for reasons nobody wanted to think about.”

“The Duchy condemns slavery,” the Duke said, frowning as he started looking around.

“Oh yes, officially. Rogue elements still operate between burgs. Company Al-Mir just took out a large slavery operation near Moonshine Burg.”

“Terrible business…”

“Indeed. But just imagine poor Ilya’s surprise when she found out that one of her family wasn’t sold off at all but was *leading* those slavers.”

“Arkk…” Alya said, fully frowning now. “You don’t understand…”

“Oh? I don’t, do I?” Arkk asked, anger rising. “I was there, seeing everything with my own eyes. Saw Ilya’s mother cavorting with—”

“Arkk!”

Arkk clamped his jaw shut, looking to where Ilya was hurrying over.

“That’s enough,” she said, voice cracking. “That’s enough.”

Arkk disagreed. Fifteen years, they thought Alya was some slave to the Duke, taken against her will. Yet here she was, standing tall next to the Duke. He didn’t know the dynamics of the situation *exactly* but he was willing to bet that she was one of the more powerful people in the Duchy in terms of politics. Vizier? And she couldn’t even write a letter to her daughter?

But he didn’t open his mouth again. He was fairly certain that, despite speaking obtusely, he was going to be thrown out of the party if he kept talking. If not by the Duke, then by Alya. So, after lightly resting a hand on Ilya’s shoulder, he stepped back.

“Ilya,” Alya said, word careful and guarded.

“Hello, mother.”

## 69 - The Party, Intercepted


Arkk stood alone in a side hallway of the Duke’s manor. He wasn’t sure that he was *supposed* to be off on his own. In all the commotion of moving the guests around, no one had stopped him and right now, he just didn’t care.

Something about seeing Alya standing there behind the Duke ticked him off. He hadn’t meant to lash out. From Ilya’s account of their first visit to Cliff and the various people who had given him information on the Duke’s advisor, he *knew* that she wasn’t being held against her will. He thought he had been prepared to maintain a calm façade, carrying on the charade that was Company Al-Mir. Instead, he had lashed out, all but shouting at her for up and leaving without a word.

It was from *seeing* her. The way she stood behind the Duke like she was as trusted to that man as Ilya was to Arkk. Her clothing, a flowing dress with silk so fine that Arkk doubted anyone from Langleey had *seen* anything comparable. The dignified posture and slight smile on her face before she realized who he was…

All of it just stirred something inside him.

When he had left, Ilya had been talking to Alya. Arkk wasn’t sure what excuses Alya was coming up with but he hadn’t wanted to hear them. He made his excuses to the Duke and slipped away before he could say something he would end up regretting.

This party had been a bad idea. Not because it was a trap or because Vrox was present—though he wasn’t quite ruling that out yet despite Vrox’s words to the contrary—but just because this… *everything* disgusted Arkk. This party. The elites of society meandered about, feasting and celebrating *nothing* but themselves while, just a jaunt down the harbor, half the city lived in squalor. Non-humans were treated like trash while an elf ran about with such a fancy title as *Vizier*. The villages outside the city limits weren’t in much of a better state. High taxes forced villages like Langleey to overfarm, leaving little room for anything else, both physically and temporally.

On his first visit to the city, he hadn’t paid all that much attention. Fortress Al-Mir had been brand new at the time and he had other problems on his hands. The Duke living large and the people living small had just been how the world worked ever since he had been able to understand it. Maybe he could have done something then but he hadn’t been in the right mindset.

There was nothing that could be done about all those problems. He was a regular guy, not someone with the power and influence of the Duke. He couldn’t make large, sweeping changes that might affect thousands or tens of thousands.

He had been thinking too small.

Now, months down the line, he had *stretched* Fortress Al-Mir. Taken it out for a walk. He had defended villages, persuaded hostile beastmen to join his cause, defeated a contingent of inquisitors, and ridded the world of a blight of slavers. For the majority of those, he hadn’t even been in the vicinity of the actual fortress.

Early on, he had mentioned overthrowing the Duke to Vezta. He had been serious but he hadn’t really seen a way to do it, even with the supposed offerings Fortress Al-Mir could provide.

Now?

He was wondering why he had let the issue lie for months.

Not *really*. Obviously, there were issues. The number one of those being simple numbers. Twenty orcs, a few specialists, and, now, fresh recruits who might not even stick around if he started a war, wouldn’t be enough to take on armies. Even if he could somehow lure the armies to the fortress, the numbers alone would overwhelm him.

Although surely not his intention, Edvin’s actions that caused the recruitment spike might have been worth more than Arkk initially thought. Non-humans would likely jump at the chance to overthrow the Duke. Even humans, although treated better, might still be interested. Especially if they came from the most heavily taxed villages in the Duchy.

Then there were the promised allies from the Underworld.

He wouldn’t quite know what he had access to—or why people from an entirely different plane of reality might come to join him in a crusade unrelated to their current existence—until he completed the ritual. All he knew was what Vezta had told him. There would be magical beings interested in traversing the boundaries between worlds. They would likely wish to undo the Calamity as well, aligning themselves with *that* goal at the very least. As magical beings, they would require the support of the Heart to survive here. At least until the Calamity was reverted and magic could flow freely.

That was the real trick of it. Making sure everyone’s goals aligned.

The orcs would probably agree to anything. Theoretically, they didn’t have a choice if they didn’t want to be handed over to the Duke’s men given their raider pasts but… Arkk wasn’t quite so willing to hold *that* over their heads at this point. They had been through too much together. Arkk was fairly confident that they were entirely for a good—or at least *successful*—fight no matter who their opponents were.

The gorgon would be harder to convince. Arkk had enticed them to Fortress Al-Mir with promises of safety and security *from* an invading army. While a few of them were willing to help out with things like the slavers, he wasn’t sure how they might react to more. It would be something to think about and feel out a bit with Khan and Zharja.

Savren was a criminal and didn’t have a choice. Unlike the orcs… Arkk didn’t particularly like the man. Or perhaps it was easier to say that the man wasn’t a very likable person. Zullie, on the other hand, might have qualms. At the same time, if Arkk ended up fighting off the inquisitors and the Abbey of the Light as a whole, the freedom to research whatever she wanted would be an enticing reward for helping out.

As for the thieves, Arkk wondered if he could drag them into this. Lexa had jumped at the idea of riches. A gold piece a month was enough to buy her loyalty. At least for the moment. Would others jump at the opportunity—

“Master.”

Plots and plans flew from Arkk’s mind as his bones leaped out of his skin. The familiar yet completely unexpected voice of Vezta at his back had his heart hammering in his chest. He turned, hand over his heart, expecting to find the servant standing in the otherwise deserted corridor. Instead, he found a stalk of oily, violet-hued flesh sticking out of an oily shadow that didn’t quite fit with the lighting in the hallway. An uncannily humanoid mouth topped the stalk, aimed in his direction.

For as used to Vezta as Arkk had grown, she really had a way of unsettling him every now and then.

“I don’t mean to disturb you—”

“Too late,” Arkk grumbled, looking around. He didn’t think Vezta would do this if anyone could see. It still felt dangerous.

“But,” she continued, undaunted. “I must inform you that I smell bodily fluids.”

Arkk frowned. He didn’t think she had startled him *that* much. Taking a whiff of the air, he wrinkled his nose. The fetid stench of a latrine filled his nostrils. Beyond the rank scent, a metallic undercurrent stung his senses. A familiar scent, both from his days as a hunter and his more recent job as a mercenary leader.

Blood.

“I smell it too,” he said, wondering how distracted he must have been to have missed it. “Hide again. We don’t know how many of the walls here have eyes.”

Whatever corridor he found himself in *appeared* deserted, that didn’t mean it actually was.

It was a servant’s hall, he assumed, something they used to travel around the manor unseen. It was far too narrow for a man like the Duke. Not in the sense that he was overweight, merely that his status inflated him beyond the need to travel through a poorly lit, cramped corridor. Arkk hadn’t been traveling through it. He was pacing back and forth as he worked out his mental frustrations over the situation.

Having delved so deeply into his thoughts, he wasn’t sure which direction to head nor which of the many doors along the walls would get him back to the party and the guards who would surely want to know about this.

That scent grew stronger as he picked a direction at random, forcing him to pull the corner of cloth from his breast pocket to hold over his mouth. It probably meant that he was heading the wrong way. Just as he was about to turn around, he spotted a door ajar not far ahead. Curiosity got the better of him and he approached, peeking inside.

Dim, worn glowstones embedded in the ceiling provided enough light to see by. It was some kind of storage room. Large tarps wrapped around old, unused furniture. Chairs were stacked up along one wall and a table with its legs removed sat against another. Shelves, boxes, and a tall armoire littered the rest of the room.

The armoire drew Arkk’s attention. It was hard not to, what with the arm dangling from its partially opened wardrobe door. The strong stench of a fresh latrine was coming from it as well. Stepping into the storage room, Arkk pulled open the armoire’s door.

A filth-covered man slumped out of the closet, falling to the ground hard enough to make Arkk wince. Not that the man felt a thing. His throat had been slit, leaving lifeless eyes staring up at Arkk.

Arkk wondered if he should have been more repulsed or panicked at seeing a dead body. As a hunter, he had seen his fair share of dead animals. Humans, however, should have been unnerving. Yet this was probably the hundredth body he had seen in the past month alone. Rather than disturbed, Arkk found himself more curious about why the body was entirely naked.

It was fresh. He could tell that much from experience, even if he wasn’t an expert. Within the last hour, he guessed. What had happened? A lover’s tryst gone wrong? That would explain the lack of attire. Except clothes would have been scattered about unless the man and his lover had traveled through the halls in the nude. There were no clothes anywhere in sight. Not to mention, a tryst going wrong feels like it would have been more of an impulsive kill. The surgical slash across the man’s neck looked far too… steady. Planned or, at least, practiced.

In fact, the slit across the man’s throat brought up memories of how Lexa had dispatched the slaver beastmasters.

He quickly checked on his stealthy employee, making sure that she wasn’t somewhere nearby. To Arkk’s relief, he found her in a tavern somewhere, casually lifting a coin purse off a man who was distracted by conversation with Edvin.

He… probably should have a chat with them about that later.

Shaking his head, Arkk backed away from the body. Guards could figure out why and how the man died. Being caught standing over it wouldn’t be a good look.

Turning, Arkk froze with a cold sweat dripping down his back.

Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox stood tall in the doorway, watching the situation with no sign of his vapid smile anywhere to be seen. “You didn’t think I would let you slip off on your own, did you?”

Arkk clenched his jaw, staring up at the tall man. “I had nothing—”

“Relax, Arkk,” Vrox said, tone serious as he swept into the room. Arkk tensed, doubly so as his shadow started roiling. However, Vrox merely stopped at his side, looking down at the body with a frown. “Not only was I following you, I told you that I studied you,” he said as he crouched down. He grasped the body’s head by the hair, looking at the man’s face before moving on to one of the man’s hands. “Murdering a random servant isn’t in my profile of you. Regardless of our… *disagreements*, you didn’t kill this man.”

Arkk let out a small breath. That… was good, right? Vrox could have used the situation to arrest him, he was sure. But instead, the man was inspecting the body.

“Servant?”

“His hair isn’t styled in the manner of the wealthy. It is grimy and unclean. Could be a guard but his hands aren’t calloused like those of someone who trains in martial combat.”

Arkk frowned down at the body. Hawkwood, during his first encounter with White Company’s leader, had pulled a similar trick, identifying Arkk as a peasant who recently came into wealth as easily as Arkk could spot the difference between a cow and a dog.

“I’ve seen kills like this before,” Arkk said, making a snap decision to assist Vrox. Not only would it hopefully keep Vrox from changing his mind about trying to have him arrested, a rather selfish aim, but it would hopefully help bring some solace to the man’s family if justice was done. Disgust with the Duke aside, the Duke’s household staff were probably innocent. “Professional, clean cut.”

“As have I,” Vrox said, looking up to the armoire. “The body was sloppily hidden.”

“Bodies are heavy,” Arkk said, again from experience. “Picking it up off the ground to shove into the armoire’s closet would have been a good amount of work for someone. Especially if they were in a hurry or…” Arkk blinked twice. “Or didn’t need it to be hidden for long. His clothes are missing. A servant’s clothes are missing.”

If this wasn’t a tryst gone wrong… if this was fully planned by someone who knew what they were doing…

“Assassin,” Vrox said, standing abruptly.

It would have been easy. Slip in during a crowded night and take a servant’s clothes. How many people knew the faces of every servant? The Duke and Alya didn’t, that much Arkk already knew from their reactions to the tall tale Zullie had spun. The majordomo might have known. Maybe a few other servants. In all the commotion of the evening, especially after all the guests had to move across the manor…

Arkk blinked in realization. Zullie had said that she hadn’t touched the lights. Even when Vrox had left and before the Duke arrived, she had said that it wasn’t her. He had thought she was just covering for herself but there was no need to lie to *him*. He wouldn’t care if she blew up the Duke’s manor. He might even give her a bonus.

“Zullie wasn’t lying about it not being her.”

“Excuse me?”

“The lights. They blew up. It wasn’t Zullie. She was telling the truth about the overload.”

Vrox’s eyes widened behind his glasses ever so slightly. “To get the guests to move. They must have needed a different room for some reason.” He turned toward the door but paused. “Why do you sound so surprised about her words?”

“Did *you* believe her when she said it wasn’t her?”

Vrox considered then shook his head.

Arkk just shrugged. “Same.”

Vrox didn’t say a word in response. He turned back to the hall. Arkk, figuring he knew which way to get back to the party, hurried alongside him.

“I trust you, Arkk.”

Arkk blinked at the sudden vote of confidence. “What?”

“Let me rephrase,” Vrox said without a pause in his steps. “I trust in my profile of you, Arkk. All of your actions demonstrate a need to help those less fortunate than you, those who find themselves in danger, and those whom you have personally impacted. You play the role of an idealistic hero. Do not betray that trust.”

“Don’t betray the… trust you have in your profile.”

Vrox half-turned his head, a vacant smile in place. “Now you’re getting it.”

Arkk disagreed. He wasn’t quite sure how Vrox could say that he trusted him even in such a roundabout way. If a fight broke out, Arkk doubted he could ever trust Vrox at his back. Even if they had a common enemy, he could just imagine that man waiting for the opportune moment to slip a dagger into his back. But then, perhaps that was just what the inquisitor was saying. Arkk didn’t think he was the kind of person to do that. At least not to Vrox. Assault on the fortress aside, they really hadn’t had poor interactions. Disagreements, as Vrox had put it, but nothing overtly hostile. Even the assault was the inquisitor carrying out his misguided duty to either rid the world of Vezta or control her.

Vrox paused in front of a door near the end of the corridor, hand on the handle. “Act as naturally as possible. If our assassin realizes that he has been discovered, he may take drastic and catastrophic action.”

“Right.”

Vrox threw open the door and immediately clamped a firm hand around Arkk’s shoulder. A spike of panic shot through Arkk, fearing he had been lulled into a false sense of security. That panic faded as he realized this *was* natural. The inquisitor ushered him into the large throne room where most of the guests had assembled.

That firm hand stayed on Arkk’s shoulder until they walked a few paces from the walls. Vrox didn’t handle him roughly. Sternly, yes. Arkk doubted his suit would even be wrinkled.

“Leave the gathering again at your own peril,” Vrox said, tone harsh.

“Just got lost,” Arkk grumbled, catching on quickly. “I clearly don’t know my way around as well as you. I’m surprised the Abbey sends you here often enough that you’ve learned its layout.”

“My duties carry me to a great many places. Some pleasant, some I’d rather not visit if at all possible.”

Arkk raised an eyebrow, wondering what the inquisitor was referring to. The Duke’s party? Or maybe the fortress? Or maybe they were just empty words for the charade they were putting on. Whatever the case, Vrox didn’t elaborate. He let go of Arkk’s shoulder.

“I’m looking out for anything suspicious,” he said, making deliberate eye contact. “This is your only warning.” Without waiting for Arkk to respond, he turned away, scanning the room once before making his way through the nearby onlookers.

Arkk shuffled his shoulders, straightening out his suit. A good dozen people, some of whom he had been introduced to even if he failed to recall their names, were watching him with expressions ranging from disapproval to moderated curiosity. Arkk didn’t find himself all that concerned with their stares. It was hard to feel self-conscious at the moment.

Not while there was an assassin somewhere in the crowd.

## 70 - The Party, Interloper


While *trying* to look mildly embarrassed over how the inquisitor admonished him, Arkk looked over the room. His eyes skipped over the gaudily dressed nobles, wealthy merchants, and mercenaries, focusing instead *between* them, on the servants that otherwise went unnoticed.

There were two kinds of servants at the party. The *entertainment*, mostly made up of non-humans showing off their bodies, dressed similarly to what Dakka had ended up wearing. The attendants, on the other hand, moved about in fine clothes that were nonetheless designed *not* to attract attention as they brought food and drink to guests, set up tables and chairs, and otherwise attended to the partygoers. They were predominantly human, though Arkk did spot a few elves among their number.

The body had been human. That didn’t exclude that he had been part of the entertainment but Arkk felt it was far more likely that the assassin had taken on the guise of an attendant. It would have been less notable.

Did one look suspicious?

The one shaking so much that the glasses on his tray rattled? The bald one handing out wine glasses? The one Dakka had up against a wall, stealing every one of the miniature snacks from his tray? Or maybe the one standing at one end of the room, hands behind his back as he looked over the guests for someone who needed attending?

There were only two dozen but that was too many for Arkk to guess at from looks alone. If he went up and inspected the hands of every one of them, he might have been able to pull the same trick as Hawkwood and Vrox. From hair and posture, Arkk couldn’t point out anyone in particular. Which was probably intentional. If he had come here intending to steal a disguise, he would have done his best to figure out how to appear so as to not draw attention.

Vrox didn’t look like he was trying to find the assassin. He moved, as casually as he could, through the guests. The throne room, while large enough to fit half of Langleey’s buildings, wasn’t as large as the ballroom, leaving far less space between the little cliques that formed among the guests. The Duke, sitting at the overly opulent throne, was at the far end of the room. Alya and Ilya weren’t far away from him, talking quietly off to one side of the hall at the far end. Ilya looked like she had either just gotten over crying or was just about to start. Alya didn’t look upset in the slightest. Pained, maybe, likely at having to come up with excuses instead of enjoying the extravagant food.

Arkk shook his head, trying to shove his irritation aside before his eyes started to glow. In doing so, he caught sight of Zullie, glowering at the crowd from where she leaned against one wall not far from a hefty winch that was connected to one of the great chandeliers. She was probably upset at the lack of strange magic to investigate. This room was lit by a series of grand chandeliers, topped with an array of amber glowstones. While the intensity at which they glowed indicated *extremely* high-quality stones, they were a far more mundane solution compared with illegal magic siphoning light from somewhere *else*.

Zullie met his gaze. *Something* must have shown on his face. She narrowed her eyes and started looking around, clearly aware that all was not as well as it seemed.

Sighing, Arkk tried to massage away any stress, rubbing the sides of his temples. It wouldn’t be good if he gave everything away. This wasn’t his battle anyway. There were guards here. Vrox was handling things.

In fact, should he even *try* to stop the assassin? The obvious target was the Duke. Hadn’t he just been ranting to himself about the Duke? Now someone was here, ready to do his job for him. Or close enough.

Actually… If the Duke *did* get assassinated, thus removing that problem from Arkk’s back, and then *he* swooped in to apprehend the assassin after the fact… He could go to the state funeral, shed some tears, but come away smelling like a proper hero for having caught the Duke’s killer.

“Everything alright there, Arkk?”

Arkk lowered his hands, giving a mild smile to Hawkwood. “Got turned around on the way to the latrine. Luckily, I bumped into the Master Inquisitor. He helped me find my way back.”

The look Hawkwood gave him was one of utter disbelief. “Few people would say that they were lucky to bump into any inquisitor. You least of all. Hasn’t the inquisition been… interested in you?”

Arkk quirked an eyebrow. “You heard about that?”

“Put out the word with a few of White Company’s branches to keep an eye on your advancements. It isn’t every day I get to mentor an up-and-coming company, let alone one that has risen to such prominence so quickly,” he said with a laugh.

Arkk glanced away from Hawkwood. The inquisitor, tall as an elf, was easy to spot as he made his way toward the Duke. He wasn’t taking a direct path, likely not wanting to agitate the assassin. He even paused to talk to someone for a few words.

“He isn’t that bad,” Arkk said eventually. “Just doing his job. We’ve had some disagreements but… I guess, *as a person*, I don’t find him all that disagreeable.”

Hawkwood’s bushy mustache ruffled as he let out a softer laugh. “That wasn’t even a proper compliment and it still sounded like torture to get it out.”

“I’m not saying I’m going to invite him to any parties *I* might hold in the future. Just that he isn’t the manic fanatic I expected from someone with the title of Master Inquisitor. He’s just doing his job.”

Hawkwood chuckled, clapping Arkk on the shoulder. “Any more of these backhanded compliments and I’m going to start worrying that *I* need to watch my back for angry inquisitors. Come. Since we’ve moved rooms, it seems the meal has been delayed. We’ve some time to kill. Did I introduce you to Victor Vector? Head of Sanctuary, a company that specializes in smaller-scale combat much like your own.”

Arkk felt his smile start to strain. He had been introduced to so many people between Hawkwood’s mercenary contacts and Wolf’s trade partners that he honestly had no idea whether or not this Victor had been included.

More than that, Hawkwood’s comment made Arkk reconsider the situation at large. They had moved rooms. While Arkk believed in coincidence, a lighting array going wrong for the first time in decades on the same night that an assassin was prowling the halls seemed unlikely. Why force the move? Was it something about the meal, delaying it to buy time to poison it, perhaps?

If the meal was poisoned, letting the assassin continue could lead to a lot more people getting hurt than just the Duke.

But if it was poisoned, the assassin might not even be here. They would be in the kitchens.

Were there other reasons for wanting the room to be swapped? Having a trap prepared in advance made the most sense. Perhaps a deadly magical circle hidden underneath the Duke’s throne. Underneath this room might be some cellar filled with explosives. The possibilities could easily spiral out of control. There were too many unknowns. Was the Duke even the target? There were a number of wealthy and powerful people here, all of whom likely had more than their fair share of enemies.

Even Arkk had probably stepped on a few toes despite Company Al-Mir only existing for a few months. If those slavers had any friends angry at their elimination, he could have a huge target on his back. The Pious of the Golden Order came to mind as well, even if none had acted against him at Moonshine Burg.

“Something else wrong?” Hawkwood said, staring at him for a short moment.

Arkk flashed a quick smile. “No,” he lied. A bald servant was distributing tall glasses of amber liquid just a few paces away. He couldn’t say anything *now* even if Hawkwood was the best person he knew who might be able to help with the situation. “Just thinking about business. I honestly can’t say that these kinds of parties are for me. I think I prefer mercenary work.”

“I understand that completely,” Hawkwood said with a firm nod of his head. “But these kinds of things can be nice changes of pace. A field of roses might be astonishingly beautiful with the most wonderful fragrance but that won’t stop you from getting sick of it after staring at it for years. Sometimes you have to step through a patch of blighted fungus just to remind yourself of the splendor.”

“That… certainly is a metaphor,” Arkk said slowly, earning another hearty laugh from Hawkwood.

Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Vrox finally making it to the Duke. The moment he leaned down to whisper into the Duke’s ear, a cry ran through the crowd. Arkk tensed, spells tingling at the tip of his tongue. His shadow curled around him with no glowing suns shining from within but ready to act nonetheless.

Vrox moved as well. From across the room, Arkk couldn’t hear his words. It was clear he managed a spell. A barrier, much like the one Zullie had demonstrated during Arkk’s first encounter with the witch, formed around Vrox and the Duke well before Arkk could have managed the same elongated spell.

But the cry hadn’t come from near the throne. Distress and alarm rippled through the crowd not far from where Dakka stood halfway through the long room. The crowd swayed and parted just enough for Arkk to see a man on the ground with a pool of blood slowly spreading out from him. Dakka had left the servant she had been harassing, clearly on the lookout for what went wrong. A contingent of guards were quickly making their way to the commotion.

But Arkk found himself scowling. Everyone was staring at the body, backing away like *it* was the problem. Who had done it? Had nobody seen? Arkk looked away, scanning the crowd again. Vrox, hidden behind the opaque barrier, would be useless here. Even with a body on the floor, Arkk was the only one who knew there was an assassin around.

It didn’t take long to spot something amiss. A man moving between the guests headed away from the body and toward the throne. No one seemed to notice him. They were too focused on the commotion to notice the servant slipping between them with steps far too sure considering the situation.

For a long moment, Arkk just watched as the bald man stepped with confidence toward the throne. Morbid curiosity held his hand. What was the man’s plan? Did he know what Zullie’s spell did? How was he going to get past it and Vrox? Vrox *and* the few guards that had gathered around Vrox’s barrier.

Arkk stepped forward, wanting to see what this assassin planned, only to be held back by a tight grip around his arm.

Licking his lips, Arkk half turned his head without taking his eyes off the bald man. “There’s a man,” he started to whisper toward Hawkwood. “I think—”

A sharp gasp of air cut Arkk off. Arkk’s eyes widened as he tore his gaze off the bald man. Hawkwood’s face, contorted and twisted in surprise and pain, slackened quickly. The grip on Arkk’s arm loosened as the man slumped forward, falling flat on the ground with a long handle sticking out from his back.

Half-pulled to the ground by the falling Hawkwood, Arkk caught sight of a servant’s shoes retreating through the crowd that had been around him and Hawkwood. There was more than one assassin? Already, more cries rang through the room. Some around Arkk. Others, more distant. Other attacks? Or people finally realizing that there was genuine danger nearby?

Arkk threw one last look after the bald man making his way toward the far end of the room, lips pressed together. “Assassins!” he called out. “Dressed as servants!” The bald man heard, changing directions as he did. So did others. Arkk didn’t chase after the man himself. He had done his part. If the assassin wanted to kill the Duke, it wasn’t Arkk’s job to protect the man.

Hawkwood, on the other hand, was a friend and mentor. Ducking down, Arkk looked over the mercenary leader with a heavy frown on his face. A dagger jutted out from the man’s back. Blood was quickly soaking into the man’s silk suit.

Focusing a hand over Hawkwood’s back, Arkk took a breath, visualized hands knitting a sweater, and spoke. “*Tenun bebarengan otot lan daging lan balung, gabungke rong bagean sing kapisah kanggo nggawe siji wutuh*.”

With his free hand, Arkk grasped the hilt of the weapon left in Hawkwood’s back and swiftly pulled it out. It was a long, needle-like dagger. Jutting under the man’s ribcage at an angle, it could have easily pierced a kidney, lung, and even his heart all in one go. Not the kind of angle an amateur attacker would be able to pull off, especially while remaining unseen despite the distraction the other attack had caused.

The Flesh Weaving spell wasn’t meant for such deep wounds. It *would* work, but it forced Arkk to close his eyes and concentrate, shutting out all the surrounding shouts and cries for help and stomping of armored boots. Magic flooded into Hawkwood from the tips of Arkk’s fingers. He could picture clearly the weaving and knitting that the spell was doing inside the man. He had seen it on surface wounds often enough, melding and shaping flesh as it did. It had originally been designed for increasing muscle mass and mutating bodies in ways that weren’t natural—it had been a spell in that black book, after all—but it was doing an adequate job of sealing the wounds caused by the thin dagger. There wasn’t much flesh damaged, after all. Just a narrow puncture.

Unless the blade had been poisoned, Hawkwood should be in one piece when Arkk finished. If he was poisoned, this was useless. That didn’t mean Arkk wouldn’t try.

Arkk’s healing came to an abrupt stop. Starting from the inside and moving out, Hawkwood was hopefully out of immediate danger. He still had a hole in his back. But Arkk found his concentration disrupted as a spike of panic ran through him. A call he had only heard a handful of times before rang through his ears. One of his employees called for his attention.

Arkk, in a panic, quickly checked on those present. Dakka was trying to make her way towards him but a blockade of guards halted her progress. They weren’t attacking her—or even focused on her—they were just trying to gain control over the situation. Zullie, on the other hand, kept her back pressed up against the wall she had been leaning against while eyeing everyone nearby. Ilya stood with Alya, not far from the Duke’s throne and the bubble Vrox had created around himself and the Duke.

Yet the call wasn’t coming from any of them. It was someone afar. Further than the Primrose and the Cliff’s Edge. Further even than Fortress Al-Mir.

Far out on the western edge of the Duchy, an employee of Fortress Al-Mir that Arkk hadn’t even met properly stood on the edge of a plateau. The half-flopkin clutched a gold coin, holding it close to her chest like she was making a wish on it. Several other full-flopkins stood around, gazing off into the distance with fear-stricken faces. Unfortunately, Arkk couldn’t control his perspective while observing his employees. It was always a top-down view of their immediate surroundings and nothing more.

Something was happening. More slavers? Being able to respond to possible slaver threats was the whole reason Arkk had asked Ilya to head up to the flopkin village in the first place.

Concerning, but it wasn’t *here*. They weren’t fleeing in terror. Whatever was going on, it could wait until he had a moment to grab a crystal ball and examine the situation properly.

Although blood stained Hawkwood’s clothes—and Arkk’s own—the bleeding had mostly stopped. A quick repeat of the incantation let him pinch together the last of the wound. Hawkwood’s breathing was shallow and his pale pallor didn’t bode well, but at least he was breathing. Arkk didn’t think there was anything else he could do for the man.

Arkk tried to stand when a second cry for help struck him through the employee link. This one joined by an immediate sensation of pain and fear. It wasn’t the flopkin.

Ilya clutched her chest, looking down at far too much blood. The bald assassin shoved her aside, pulling out a dagger from her stomach before advancing on Alya. The older elf, fear on her face, stepped back from the assassin. Her step carried her outside Arkk’s perspective.

Arkk sat in shock for what felt like an eternity. The gears in his mind ground against each other. This was his fault. He had ignored the assassin, assuming his target to be the Duke. What had happened? Had the assassin gone after Alya when Ilya jumped in the way? Or what if the assassin didn’t know what his target looked like, only that it was an elf with silver hair. He might have decided to attack both. Or…

Or…

Fists clenched, Arkk stood, only to freeze as he found himself looking down the edge of a sword. A contingent of knights, bearing the emblem of the Duke on their ceremonial armor coverings, looked like they weren’t sure if they wanted to attack or flee from his presence. He had a feeling he knew why. The guards wore shiny, polished armor that looked like it had never seen proper combat. Ceremonial, likely. That shiny polish made the suits reflective.

Each of the soldiers had twin red lights gleaming off their armor. Even their tabards and the stone floor gleamed with bright red light. Brighter than Arkk had ever seen it before.

A man hunched over a bloody Hawkwood, casting spells with glowing red eyes, probably hadn’t been the best for optics. Arkk didn’t care. Certainly not *now*. He didn’t have *time* to try to explain away the misunderstanding.

He spoke one single word.

“Vezta.”

---

## 71 - The Party, Incinerated


A black, oily tendril flung out from Arkk’s shadow as a dozen burning suns manifested in the dark mass surrounding Arkk. The soldiers accosting Arkk, standing far too close and not expecting any kind of monster to attack them, were handily batted aside. Armored knights bowled through the guests and crowd. Fresh screams of panic and terror from both guard and onlooker joined with the cacophony already present in the throne room.

Arkk strode forward, moving through the cleared space and leaving Hawkwood behind. The guards would hopefully pick themselves up and help him. If not… Unfortunately, Arkk could only be in one place at a time. Even with as much as he owed Hawkwood for his help, Ilya took priority.

Vezta took form alongside him, transitioning from her shadowy state to a fully corporeal body mid-stride. Between the guards being thrown around, Vezta’s appearance, and Arkk’s glowing eyes, people were doing the best they could to get out of the way. A large number were running *toward* the throne, perhaps hoping to seek protection from the Duke’s guards. It just wasn’t enough. There were already panicked people running in the opposite direction from whatever the assassins had done, crashing into others and taking them down, creating a mass of people all pushing against each other.

He could easily order Vezta to throw them all out of the way. Fighting through the entire crowd and getting more soldiers trying to surround him was less than ideal. Instead, he turned to Vezta. “*Cranium Internum*.”

Vezta jolted slightly as Arkk’s perspective shifted. Then her body jolted again. This time, forward toward Ilya. Her body broke apart, losing its humanoid form to a mass of tendrils. He wasn’t controlling any tendril individually. Intention guided him, pulling him where he wanted to go. One with Vezta, Arkk lurched over the crowd of frightened guests and guards.

As an amorphous mass more akin to the lesser servants, they couldn’t hope to stop him. His body simply deformed, stretching out or constricting to fit between any gap of people that he could find. Covered with eyes, and not stunned by the sight of the shattered sky, he could instantly pick out the optimal path to take among dozens of options. He could also see *everything* around him.

One guard in particular, hand thrust out in an offensive motion, was trying to cast a spell in his direction. Arkk’s body simply twisted and deformed, easily squishing underneath the glowing green chains that lashed out from the man’s hand. Vezta’s body didn’t even lose any of its forward momentum.

Cresting a group of fleeing guests, many of whom dived upon seeing Vezta’s body stretching over them, Arkk got a clear look at the far end of the room. Inquisitor Vrox was still protecting the Duke inside the spell while a contingent of guards had arrayed themselves in front of the throne. Most of *these* guards looked less ceremonial and more functional, though still with a bit more opulence than anyone would go to battle with.

A distance from the throne, near the wall, Ilya was slumped in a heap on the ground. She wasn’t moving at all. Alya had backed up toward the throne, earning the protection of the guards there. The assassin…

He fled, rushing toward one of the walls not far from where Zullie was taking up her guard position. Wrong idea. Zullie, noticing, flicked her wand in the assassin’s direction. The same wind spell that she had used to clean up after testing the Langleey villagers swept the assassin off his feet, throwing him straight back toward Arkk.

Arkk wasn’t sure if Zullie intended that but Arkk wasn’t going to complain. Tendrils lashed around the bald assassin, gripping him and pulling him close. Terror, unbridled fear, twisted the man’s features. He struggled and thrashed in Arkk’s grip, trying to escape. He shouted and pleaded and…

Stopped.

All at once, he stopped moving. For a moment, Arkk thought he had somehow killed the man.

“It’s you.”

A dozen eyes across Arkk’s body blinked. At the same time, the assassin squeezed his eyes shut, grimacing as if a sudden pain struck him.

“It’s you. It’s you. It’s… [you]…” The man’s eyes slowly opened, just a sliver at first. Bright, golden light mixed with the red coming from Vezta’s many eyes. “[Found]/[Hide and Seek]|[Over]—”

Arkk’s tendrils moved on their own. Or rather, *Vezta* fought against his control, just enough to *twist*. The man’s head went from looking straight at Arkk to looking straight behind him. Arkk let the limp body drop to the ground, staring as the golden light reflecting off the floor flickered and dimmed.

Ilya let out a faint groan, barely audible over the crowd yet somehow impossibly loud in Arkk’s ears, ringing like a gong. He ended the possession spell in an instant, dropping to the ground beside Vezta mid-dash. Crashing to his knees, Arkk hesitated. Ilya was… not in a good state. Far, far worse than Hawkwood. Hawkwood’s wound had been deep but surgical, a straight stab through a majority of the man’s vital organs.

Ilya had been *flayed*. She must have tried to fight back. Without weapons or armor… Her arms had been torn to ribbons and her chest… It was like someone had stabbed her a dozen times over, each a twisting, ripping stab. Even among all the orcs and the various wounds they had sustained in battle against the slavers and inquisitors, none had been remotely as bad. That was the difference between armored combat against a fighter and getting attacked by a trained man to kill.

“Vezta,” Arkk said, not sure of even where to begin. “Is there anything…”

“I am sorry, Master,” Vezta said, having reformed her human form at his back. “I can seal small wounds, cuts, and scrapes. Something like this is beyond my abilities. Your spell to mold flesh stands a better chance. Failing that…” She trailed off for a moment. When she spoke again, a note of distaste entered her tone. “Failing that, the so-called *holy* magic wielded by the likes of priests, abbesses, and inquisitors would be your best option.”

Arkk shot a glance up to the throne. Vrox still had the projectile shield up in action. It looked like it had thinned a bit. Strain? Arkk hadn’t used it ever, so he wasn’t sure how draining the spell was. It had thinned to the point where Arkk could see Vrox beyond the shimmering swirl of the magic.

And Vrox could see him. Or, rather, see *out*. His eyes weren’t on Arkk at all. He stared directly at Vezta.

Would he help if Arkk asked? Arkk might have said no before this night but… now… He figured the answer might be yes, though conditional. Arkk glanced back at Vezta for a brief moment before shaking his head.

“There is still another assassin. The one who got Hawkwood. Can you locate him? Failing that, get Zullie and Dakka here.”

“I will not leave your side. If they arrive, I will protect them to the best of my ability.”

With a grimace, hoping he wasn’t making another mistake, Arkk nodded his head. Zullie should have a clear path toward him. Dakka was further back in the room but unless the assassin had gone back, she should be out of harm’s way.

He had to focus on Ilya.

Peeling up the top of her dress, Arkk grimaced at the state of her body. Steeling himself, he chanted the incantation for Flesh Weaving and *focused*, trying to feel out for the largest injury. Holy spells, he knew from asking Abbess Keena when he first learned he had the capacity for magic, didn’t require much thought put into them. They were miracles granted by the Holy Light. Not something mortal men had come up with on their own. A holy spell here would have simply restored her body. They weren’t universal cure-alls, there were limits, but with something like this where Arkk couldn’t even visualize what might be damaged, a priest would have had a much easier time than he.

That didn’t stop Arkk from trying. He felt around, physically pressing his fingers against Ilya’s wounds. Contact made Ilya’s muscles tense up, which Arkk took as a good sign. Was she breathing? It was shallow at best but there. A pinch here. Smoothing the flesh of an organ over there. Her stomach and abdomen were the worst. The assassin hadn’t tried going through her ribcage. Neither had he angled his blade upward. He had simply tried to put Ilya down in order to get to Alya, who could only be the *actual* target.

Why Alya and not the Duke? Was it because of the inquisitor protecting the Duke and Alya was just a secondary target?

Why start with anyone *but* the Duke? Killing someone out in the middle of the crowd was sure to start a panic. Even if the inquisitor hadn’t been present, surely the Duke would have been escorted to safety long before the killers could make their way through the crowd.

Arkk pushed a healthy dose of magic into Ilya, hopefully mending perforations and not making things worse. She had lost a lot of blood. So much blood. Kneeling on the ground, it felt like he had fallen into a muddy puddle of warm muck. But it was all from Ilya. Flesh Weaving couldn’t fix that. He had to hope that she hadn’t lost *too* much. His efforts were, at the very least, staunching the wounds enough to slow her bleeding.

Unless that was just her body running out of blood. Grimacing, wishing he had more practice on deep wounds, Arkk worked faster.

All the while, Arkk could feel eyes on him. Alya stood with mild injuries, simply watching him. She wasn’t moving to help or hinder. More guards had surrounded him and Ilya. Vezta wasn’t assaulting them, though with her tendrils stretched out around the area, she was warding them off. Inquisitor Vrox had finally let the spell drop, though even he wasn’t doing more than simply staring.

Had Vrox ever used actual holy magic? Arkk didn’t think so. Regular spells, yes, but in the fight at the false fortress, only the chronicler had used holy spells. Perhaps Vrox was incapable, which would make pleading for his help useless anyway.

A quick check through his employee links found both Dakka and Zullie still safe. Though Dakka looked about ready to start swinging at a few guards who weren’t letting her get closer to the Duke—and Arkk. Zullie still had her back to the wall. She was edging toward the front of the room but she was being cautious about it. It wouldn’t be long before she ran into the line of guards trying to keep people away from the Duke though.

It was odd. Arkk pinched closed one wound before throwing a glance over his shoulder. Behind the line of guards surrounding him, there was a brief gap before the next line of guards keeping the general public away. But it didn’t look like they were letting anyone out. Trying to capture the assassin? Or…

Had the assassins activated a trap of some kind? Sealing everyone into the room? There were doors along the walls but none were open.

The thought sent a chill down Arkk’s spine, forcing him to look up from Ilya. There was *at least* one assassin left.

They forced a room change. They trapped people in. They targeted a few select individuals. Arkk wasn’t sure who else had been attacked but based on Hawkwood and Alya, they were important individuals. And now, with half the garrison having made it into the room, trying to maintain order and people unable to leave, what was their next move?

“Vezta,” Arkk started, only to trail off as he spotted movement between the legs of the distant guards. The movement caught his eye because most of the crowd wasn’t moving at the moment. The feet appeared again, a few steps forward between some other sets of legs, moving perpendicular to the length of the room. Toward the wall where Zullie was.

“Vezta!” Arkk shouted, far more urgently. “He is heading toward Zullie!”

“Master, I won’t—”

Casting one look at Ilya, hoping he had done enough, Arkk grit his teeth. He wasn’t going to let any of his employees or friends die here. Some might call him greedy but he couldn’t just watch an assassin casually approach Zullie. Maybe she would blast him away with her wand again or maybe she would get caught off-guard. He couldn’t take the risk.

“*Jalan yang paling banyak dilalui menyediakan jalur yang stabil untuk maju ke tujuan Anda dengan aman,*” he spat out as fast as his tongue would allow, focusing on a stone brick road while swinging his arms down over his head as if wielding a heavy construction hammer. Not the easiest motion to make while trying to stand but all of Zullie’s magic—*regular* magic—required an element, visualization, and gesture.

As soon as his imaginary hammer struck the ground, ethereal bricks fell from above, forming a road of transparent cobblestone. The moment his foot stepped on the first magical brick, he felt more sure of his stance. His legs moved with an ease that couldn’t be explained through mundane means. His speed increased.

It had the added benefit of frightening a number of the guards ahead of him, sending them scattering to the sides in fear of an attack despite the bricks passing harmlessly through several of them. The effect didn’t extend far, unfortunately. A few paces. Although the swiftness stuck with him when he stepped off the road, it didn’t clear his path toward Zullie enough to sling a lightning bolt at the assassin.

Vezta tried to stop him. *Tried*. Capable though she was, her tendril lashing out to restrain him just moved so slowly from his perspective. It barely took any effort to step aside. By the time she realized she missed, he was already *leaping* over the second line of guards. Her attempt to stop him was exactly why he hadn’t tried possessing her again. He didn’t want her fighting him the whole way.

Now, he flew through the crowd of guests and soldiers. Supernatural stability allowed him to shift directions without losing speed, bouncing around, dodging individuals while making his way to the other side. It caused a commotion, naturally, drawing the eyes of guests and guards alike. It caused enough of a commotion that he spotted the sandy hair of the servant jolting forward, discarding subtlety in favor of haste.

Although he had a supernatural swiftness, the assassin had the lead on him. The throne room was large and opulent, longer than it was wide.

Zullie wasn’t defenseless, however. She had that wand, not to mention her library of spells. Arkk wasn’t sure if she noticed the assassin or if Arkk rushing at her tipped her off but the effect was the same either way. A gale of wind blasted through the crowd. Guests went flying through the air, landing on top of each other. Guards, weighed down by heavier armor, mostly fell over. Some managed to maintain their footing.

The assassin must have been prepared. Maybe he saw Zullie ready her spell, maybe he simply never let his guard down. The man rolled into the gust of wind ahead of Arkk, springing up to his feet the moment it passed.

With the crowd cleared away, however, Arkk could act. “*Electro*—”

The man must have heard Arkk’s incantation beginning. He dove to the side, hiding among people who had been out of the way of the blast.

“Run!” Arkk shouted. “He’s after you! Get to Vezta!”

Zullie didn’t argue. She didn’t turn and run either. Rather, she backed away, wand at the ready. Wise. Turning her back on an assassin wouldn’t be a good idea.

Arkk’s eyes slid away from Zullie, trusting in her ability to get to the safety of Vezta as long as he kept the assassin distracted for just a few seconds longer. People were running again, fleeing. Trying to push through the guards and escape the danger. The assassin wasn’t. The situation had gone wrong, yet he still pressed forward. Not toward Zullie now, but to the wall? 

“*Electro*—” Arkk started again, only for the assassin to whip his head around. The man grabbed hold of a passing guest, a shorter man with wine staining the front of his disheveled shirt. A merchant whom Arkk was fairly certain Wolf had introduced earlier in the evening. Not that Arkk remembered his name.

He did try to struggle. That only lasted as long as it took the assassin to jam the tip of a sharp blade into his throat. It didn’t puncture the skin but it was clear that it would take little effort to cut the man’s throat. The merchant realized this as well. He dragged the merchant backward, one step at a time. The guards were quickly assembling, swords drawn. This time, they weren’t aimed toward Arkk. At least, not all of them. In short order, the assassin had his back to the wall, right where Zullie had been standing only moments before.

“Surrender,” one of the guards barked. “You are surrounded. There is nowhere to run. Your accomplices have been—”

The assassin let out a cry, inarticulate and angry. He shoved the merchant forward, forcing the closest guards to pull back lest they stab the man on their readied blades. Rather than try to flee, the assassin turned and stabbed his blade into the gearing of the winch against the wall. With a twist and a pull, the metal snapped.

The chain of the winch, leading up to one of the large chandeliers over the Duke’s throne, unspooled rapidly. Vrox grabbed the Duke, throwing both of them off the throne platform even as the chandelier crashed down. Even had they not moved, it alone likely wouldn’t have *killed* either of them.

But the moment the chandelier’s glowstones touched the ground, a deafening shockwave rippled out from the center. The violence of it felt like another gust from Zullie’s wind, except infused with a heat that scaled Arkk’s skin as it threw him to the floor.

Ears ringing and vision swimming, the last of Arkk’s cognizance focused on the assassin’s face appearing overhead, golden light shining from his eyes as he raised a blade to strike down. Arkk tried for a spell but the words came out slurred and unsteady.

A black, oily tendril snaked around the assassin’s neck. With a twist and a pull, the assassin fell limp just as Arkk blacked out.

## 72 - Aftermath of the Duke's Party - Hawkwood


Hawkwood hadn’t expected to wake. Ever. He could remember what happened well enough. The commotion at the party. A sharp stabbing sensation in his back. The attempt to call for help as his legs went weak. The shocked expression on Arkk’s face. Finally, the sudden rush of lightheadedness, akin to standing too fast except far, *far* more severe.

He knew then, as the darkness took him, that he was dead. His heart stabbed straight through.

Now, he could feel his heart hammering in his head, throbbing and aching, he was *awake*. He blinked bleary eyes up at a mural-covered ceiling that was familiar but one he couldn’t quite place. Not until he managed to look around. It still took him a long minute.

People were lying in neat rows. Bodies? Some were alive. Some… weren’t. An abbess rushed past a few, stopping at a man Hawkwood recognized. The leader of the Order of the Claymores. A golden, holy light dripped from the fingertips of the abbess. A healing spell and a fairly powerful one. Hawkwood recognized that as well. Behind the abbess, two alchemists, dressed in the typical garb of their profession with long beak-like masks and dark cloaks, mixed a thick, green-colored ungent. Another healing concoction.

Slowly, Hawkwood turned his head. This was the Duke’s entry hall. Large and crowded. It was filled with injured people. Healers of varying professions moved about by the dozens, tending to those injured. Guards stood at every door—and not just the ceremonial guards in shining armor that the Duke kept around for show, but more rugged guards clearly pulled from the garrison.

Pinching his eyes closed, Hawkwood ground his teeth together and pushed himself up. A pinching pain in his back kept him from getting fully on his feet. It was like someone had grasped hold of every scrap of loose skin and was pulling it tight. Sitting, he tried to feel around his back—someone had removed most of his clothing during his unconsciousness, leaving him with a thin white bandage wrapped around his chest—but he couldn’t quite reach the spot with the most pain.

“You shouldn’t be up. You need rest.”

Hawkwood turned to find a priest moving from one of the wounded to another. He didn’t stop to chat but did settle down not far from Hawkwood. “I’ll rest when I’m dead. What happened?”

“Don’t know the details,” the priest said, peeling back bandages to inspect a wound. “Heard that there was an attack. Several were outright killed before an explosion claimed and wounded many more. Excuse me,” he said, reaching into the folds of his robe. He withdrew a small talisman that he quickly slapped against the man’s chest, muttering a prayer as he did so.

Hawkwood didn’t disturb him any further, letting the man walk away to tend to the next victim. Taking a breath and using the wall as a support, he dragged himself to his feet. He needed to find someone who knew what was going on. Someone who wasn’t a healer. Hawkwood knew better than most that in a situation like this, it was always better to leave the healers to their duties.

He had a headache and a pinch in his back. Walking wasn’t all that difficult or taxing, however. His legs worked and his balance was good enough. This wasn’t the first time he had woken while wounded. In fact, out of all the injuries he had received, this affected him the least. Given that he had been sure he wouldn’t wake at all, that was saying something. The healers must have done good work.

Hawkwood started toward a guard captain, only to pause as he realized that it wasn’t just the Duke’s men present. The distinctive black chevron of White Company stood out among the blue and white striped shields. Once he realized that his company was present, it didn’t take long to pick out Field Captain Rurik. He was somewhat surprised that they hadn’t been at his side. Then again, sitting at the side of an unconscious man didn’t help anything.

While the Duke’s men and garrison guard stood watch at the main entrance and prowled through the injured, clearly looking for any threats, White Company took up position around the large doors to the throne room. As he approached, he heard a knocking on the door. A specific pattern. Rurik tensed at the first knock but quickly relaxed and motioned for the others to open the door. They did so, admitting another pair of White Company soldiers who were carrying a body between them. One that didn’t look particularly healthy. Hawkwood couldn’t even tell if she was alive. Half her face had been burned away and bits of stone stuck out of her chest.

Hawkwood was pleased to note that neither of the ones carrying the wounded—maybe dead—girl stopped to acknowledge him. Aid ran before all. Those of White Company who were not carrying a body, on the other hand, quickly saluted him as he stepped closer.

“Sir, shouldn’t you—”

“One word about me needing rest and I’ll have you digging latrines next training run.”

Rurik snapped his jaw closed, though not without a slim smile touching the corners of his lips. “Good to see you up, sir. You didn’t look too injured but when we heard you were specifically targeted…”

Hawkwood closed his eyes, drawing in a deep breath. “What happened? Report.”

“Assassins disguised as servants. Three, it seems, though we can only account for two at the moment.”

Rurik took his eyes off Hawkwood, looking slowly around the room as if he might be able to spot the third one now that he had mentioned it. Hawkwood did the same, though hopefully less obviously. He did reposition, making sure White Company was at his back and not the larger room.

“They targeted at least six individuals specifically before causing an explosion in the throne room that resulted in *this*,” Rurik said, continuing with a wave of his hand around the entry hall. “Of the six specifically targeted… it seems only you and Vizier Alya have survived.”

“How?”

“Not sure. At least in your case. Someone healed you. A few guards were going on about a glowing-eyed demon attacking you but not who helped you.”

“Demon?” Hawkwood said, narrowing his eyes as he cast yet another suspicious glance around the large hall. A demon certainly could have caused this. The fact that he was alive probably meant that it was an exaggeration, however. Stress and panic in a situation like what had happened would be far from unheard of. “Who else was targeted specifically?”

“General Yurt and General Josen of the Duke’s Grand Guard, Commander Rozen of the Red Rose Company, and Welkins Huntz of Huntz Trading Company.”

“Not Duke Woldair?”

“He may have been planned as a target but reports say that the Master Inquisitor Vrox made it to him and protected him just before the incident occurred.”

“They made it out then?”

Rurik looked around then dropped his tone to a near whisper. “Not exactly. Neither got a knife in the back like you did but they were at the center of the explosion. The Duke’s guards carried both away before we arrived. I presume they are somewhere else in the manor, somewhere less trafficked than here. I guess the Pontiff Bernardin arrived early on and was taken straight to them. Haven’t heard anything from them since. That would have been well over two hours ago now.”

Hawkwood pursed his lips in thought. Two generals of the Duke’s men, three mercenary company leaders, the elf advisor, and the head of a trading company. The last was a small outlier in the pattern until he recalled that Huntz Trading Company made its name during the war thirty years ago when they provided heavy logistical support to the soldiers.

“The Evestani Sultanate?”

“Sir?”

“Tensions have been high for a few months now. We figured war would begin in the spring when armies could march. Yet here they are trying to cripple the leadership of the armies and large mercenary companies…” Hawkwood swallowed, weight dragging his shoulders down. “Where is the Duke’s spymaster? How did we get caught so unaware?”

“Sorry. I don’t have any other information. Except…”

Hawkwood frowned as Rurik went uncharacteristically silent. It wasn’t like him to be hesitant about reporting information. He, and all of White Company, knew that Hawkwood was not the type to get upset at messengers. Even if they were at fault for something, as long as they were genuinely sorry and attempted to make amends, he wouldn’t be too harsh. “Except?” Hawkwood had to prod.

“There is something else. A… situation inside the throne room. The reason *we’re* here instead of the manor guards.”

“I didn’t know you were so good at dancing, Rurik. You sat out at Piter’s wedding. If I had known you were this good, I’d have insisted you show us your talents.”

Rurik gave Hawkwood a flat look, rolling his eyes before glancing at the door. “I don’t know about demons… but there is *something* in there. It hasn’t attacked yet but…” Rurik shuddered. “The Duke’s men and spellcasters have sealed all the doors except this one and we had to insist, taking responsibility here, just to get injured out.”

“Now you’re starting to make me worried.”

“Maybe it is best if you see for yourself,” Rurik said, backing up to the door. At their approach, two more of White Company, Felix and Tavyn, pulled open the throne room doors. They started just a crack, the latter peering inside as if worried something might rush out. When nothing did, they opened the doors just wide enough to admit Hawkwood and Rurik.

Bodies were strewn everywhere. More toward the far end of the room than the front. Given that walls were scorched, stone had cracked, the ceiling had partially caved in, and two chandeliers were missing, Hawkwood assumed that was where the explosion had taken place. Far from where he had been standing with Arkk when he had been attacked.

Where was Arkk anyway? Hawkwood hadn’t inspected the entirety of the entry hall but hadn’t noticed the other company leader in any of his cursory glances.

While the chaos and carnage of the far end of the room drew his eyes initially, movement closer to him pulled his attention. He tensed, somewhat nervous from Rurik’s words, only to relax.

He didn’t know where Arkk was but recognized two of Arkk’s people working in the dark room. The orc that had joined him for dinner, Dakka, was at one of the chandelier winches, slowly lowering it to the ground.

“Slowly. Slowly.” The one introduced as a magical researcher stood between the orc and the wall, using the orc’s large body as a shield between herself and the chandelier.

“I know,” Dakka snapped.

“Almost there. Gently. Gently.”

“Will you shut up?”

“Three, two… Lock it in place.”

The orc slid a pin into the winch, keeping it from turning any further. She curled her lips back, baring her tusks at the researcher—who didn’t seem to notice or care—before realizing that they had an audience.

“Dakka, Zullie, was it? Is Mister Arkk—”

Hawkwood started forward only to be held back by a hand on his arm. Rurik gave him a sharp look before nodding back past the lowered chandelier and the two members of Company Al-Mir.

It took Hawkwood a moment to notice. That whole end of the room was dark with the missing light and there were plenty of bodies and scoring in the walls that drew the attention. Staring at it a second time, Hawkwood realized that one corner was just a bit *too* dark. Shadows churned against the walls, twisting and moving in ways that didn’t make sense given the stillness of other lights. Then there were the bright yellow orbs hanging in the darkness. Orbs that shifted, moved, and *watched*.

Hawkwood felt a sudden weakness in his knees. If not for Rurik keeping him steady, he might have fallen in shock. It didn’t help that he already felt somewhat unsteady from his headache and the pinch in his back. Seeing… *something*, as Rurik had put it, had his heart hammering in his chest.

“—some magical bombs made to explode when jostled,” Dakka was saying to him while the witch started circling the lowered chandeliers. “All the room’s chandeliers were made to explode but, whether due to flaws in construction or simple luck, only two did. We disarmed those two,” she said, throwing a thumb over her shoulder. “Not too keen on having them explode on us.”

“I would say it is luck they didn’t all go off in sequence when the first one did,” Zullie grumbled, not looking up. She reached out with a scoring knife and, with sweat dripping off her brow, made a few careful marks on the upper part of the chandelier.

“Exactly. Don’t know what else might set them off so she’s… what was it again? Dispersing the stored magic or something like that.”

“What…” Hawkwood said, “is *that*?”

Dakka, following his pointed finger, stared at the abyss. The abyss stared back but apparently not hard enough to warrant more than a casual shrug from the orc. “Oh, that? Just Vezta. She’s watching over Arkk. He took a bit of a knock in the explosion. Still alive and he has started to stir a bit. Hope he wakes up soon because I would really like to get out of here before some people get funny ideas.”

Hawkwood barely heard what Dakka said beyond the name. It was familiar. It didn’t take long to figure out where he heard it from. “The demihuman with a skin condition?”

Dakka looked back to the abyss again. “Uh. Yes. Her… uh… skin condition is quite bad today, as you can see. Another good reason to leave soon. I don’t suppose you can help with that? Arkk should have a few ways to get us out of here but he’s out. I doubt he wants us fighting our way out. I don’t favor that fight either. Too many against too few.” Dakka paused as Zullie grumbled something else. “Right. That too. I don’t suppose you know where Ilya is? They carted her off along with her mother.”

“I…”

Hawkwood didn’t know what to say. Though looking at that abyss against the far wall of the throne room, he did have a feeling that he knew how Arkk managed to get to the gorgon in Silver City without being petrified. Vezta. That… *thing* over there had been at his dinner table, looking odd but not like *that*.

What was she? A demon as the guard suspected? They had said someone with glowing eyes had been standing over him. He had been near Arkk. Vezta being associated with him… But Arkk hadn’t attacked him. He had been surprised. That shock on Arkk’s face was burned into Hawkwood’s mind. It was the last thing he saw before he passed out.

“Is… *she* dangerous?”

“Only if you want to harm Arkk,” Dakka said with another casual shrug. “Told your men she wouldn’t be an issue. Didn’t stop them from tiptoeing around though. Really, I would be more worried about this.” Dakka waved a hand to where Zullie was making another scoring line on the main shaft of the chandelier.

A loud hissing noise came from the metal. Both of them jumped back. Zullie lost her grip on the scoring knife, leading to a loud clatter as it hit the floor. Rurik tried to pull Hawkwood back but his efforts were unnecessary. As quickly as it started, the hissing stopped. Everything went silent save for the tense breathing of the four people.

“That didn’t happen on the other ones,” Dakka said, taking another wary step back.

“I think it is a good sign,” Zullie said, also taking another step back.

“You *think*?”

“Well it didn’t explode, did it? Just a harsh dispersal. Nothing to be worried about.”

“That why you jumped out of your boots? Your tool is over there, right next to the stupid thing. Why not pick it up?”

“Why not shut up?”

“Do you even know what you’re doing?”

Hawkwood watched the byplay between the two, slowly relaxing. If either were concerned with an imminent explosion, he presumed they would have turned tail and run in the opposite direction. He found his gaze wandering beyond them to that abyss against the back wall. No matter what Dakka said, he found that far more worrying.

Although he had been more or less confined to a desk for the better part of the last five years, Hawkwood considered himself a well-traveled man. He had been a part of several mercenary organizations in his time, fighting everything from simple bandits to foreign armies, delving into ancient tombs and climbing to the highest mountains, sailing the seas, and crossing the volcanic planes of the Dead Isle. With all he had seen, very little surprised him.

This, he didn’t recognize. He had written the book—or at least several chapters—on tactics against beings with unusual abilities. It, this Vezta, was monstrous to the point where his mind could only jump back to ancient myths and legends. A pre-Calamity monster.

Where had Arkk dug up something like this?

It was little wonder that the throne room had been sealed off by the Duke’s spellcasters. Even if there truly was no danger, Hawkwood couldn’t help but feel a tingle of pride at *his* men braving this room to recover any survivors who had been left behind. They were a gallant crew, better than he deserved.

The problem was, what happened now? Even if it was only the guard and his men, something Hawkwood doubted given the situation, people would talk. It wouldn’t surprise him at all if the only reason the Duke’s men hadn’t charged in was because this incident had shaken their organizational structure. Who was calling the shots? It sounded like the Duke was incapacitated and two generals were dead. There was a hierarchy but some captain who had been woken up in the last hour with no clue as to what was going on couldn’t command effectively.

The inquisitors… were already harassing Arkk. Probably because of this monster. Master Inquisitor Vrox had been incapacitated as well. That might be the only reason half the church wasn’t bearing down on this room as well. That wouldn’t last, however. There were other inquisitors. Other officials. Like with the Duke’s men, it would take some time but they would get organized eventually. Likely sooner than anyone would like.

What of him? Hawkwood considered himself and his men. White Company was large. Per their contract, only the Duke could order them around. Still, if a threat befell the city, White Company would act even without orders. Throwing them against a pre-Calamity monster that they knew nothing about wasn’t something he aspired toward. It was clearly strong. Arkk hadn’t mentioned it before but it did fill in a few gaps of just how Arkk managed to convince a bunch of raiders to take up a more noble profession, not to mention his other seemingly unlikely feats.

Trying to attack the creature was, at the moment, unnecessary. It wasn’t doing anything but guarding Arkk. If the Duke or the Abbey of the Light decided to act, however, it would be a disaster. Another tragedy on top of an already trying evening.

The Evestani Sultanate had attacked, clearly aiming to weaken those in command. Send the Duchy into disarray. They didn’t need more good men dying against something that wasn’t even an enemy.

Was it the right thing to do? Hawkwood wasn’t sure. He wasn’t a cleric and knew nothing of such beings. Perhaps this would end with the inquisition harassing *him*. Nevertheless, he stepped forward, brushing off Rurik’s hand in the process, certain that a fight with Company Al-Mir was not in *anyone*’s interests.

## 73 - Aftermath of the Duke's Party - Vrox


Master Inquisitor Darius Vrox stared around the throne room, grimacing at every body his eyes crossed. As an inquisitor, he walked alongside death more than most. That didn’t mean he was a cold and heartless being, not even toward those he didn’t particularly enjoy the company of. Which, unfortunately, included most people the illustrious Duke held in confidence.

Still, few deserved to be ripped apart by the force of a violent explosion. Several of those closest to the blast weren’t recognizable. They ceased being people and instead became piles of mulched meat and bone. The Abbey of the Light had sent out their healers. They were taking care of those who had survived.

It was a wonder he had survived. The Duke as well. The trapped chandelier had fallen just in front of the throne, not ten steps away from where he had been standing. Darius eyed the raised platform where the Duke’s throne had sat before being shattered against the wall. It was a stone dais that only went up a few steps. It was not flush with the back wall, however. There was a small gap. Throwing the Duke in before taking cover himself had saved them.

It had been a close thing. Closer for him than for the Duke. The blast, or the flying bits of brass and glowstone carried through the air, had shredded his back. One had gotten deep into his leg. A cane slammed down onto the tiles, taking pressure off that leg as he turned around. Tap, step, light-step. Tap, step, light-step.

He found it somewhat amusing that he had come away with more grievous injuries incidentally from being in the periphery of an attack on the Duke compared with a direct assault on Arkk. Yet, as much as he would prefer to investigate just how the assassins had infiltrated so deeply into the Duke’s midst, he had his duty to perform.

Darius wasn’t quite sure what to think of Arkk at the moment. They fought. He abducted Purifier Agnete. Then he shows up in the city like nothing happened, brazenly walking around as if he knew that the inquisitors wouldn’t lay a hand on him while there were so many potential hostages around, not to mention Greesom’s continuing convalescence. Darius didn’t think he would take hostages—he felt he knew Arkk better than that—yet orders were orders. He had maintained a distance, observing only. The party provided a few moments where he felt he could interact without disobeying orders. He had planned on needling Arkk a bit, perhaps discovering what the man had done with Agnete.

Then *this*.

Darius stepped outside the throne room and looked to the nearest guard. One who had been too frightened to follow him inside. “He isn’t here.”

“What? But… I… That’s impossible,” the man stuttered, tripping over his words as he *dared* to peer into the throne room. “The only ones in or out have been White Company. They carried the wounded out. I think we would have noticed that *thing* slipping by,” he said with a visible shudder.

Did the guard not understand where the creature had come from in the first place? It could disguise itself or everyone at the party would have known about it well in advance of it making an appearance. Darius didn’t bother entertaining the guard any further, tapping his cane on the ground with every other step as he made his way through the entrance hall of the Duke’s manor.

He had already run through a quick check of all the injured. Arkk wasn’t among them. Neither were any of Company Al-Mir.

A few mercenaries wearing the black chevron of White Company stood about, mostly helping the healers where they could. Darius chose not to waste more time with them. They might have known something. It was just as likely they did not. He hadn’t waited around to be healed fully before leaving specifically because he expected that this might happen. There was limited time and he only had one real lead on where Company Al-Mir might be.

Darius limped out of the entrance hall, leaving the building. Guards were in place to try to stop most people from going anywhere, leaving the guards within to try to find any further evidence of hidden assassins. As with the members of White Company, they might know something or they might not. He stalked right past them. They didn’t bother to stop him.

Unfortunately, walking across Cliff wasn’t possible at the moment. Not with his fresh injuries. His own coach wasn’t present. It was likely that Douglas or some other church authority had already started using it for other purposes. Perhaps ferrying healers around or moving the less wounded to somewhere they would be out of the way. There were several horses and coaches outside the manor, ripe for the taking. So long as he wore the regalia of the Inquisition, no one would stop him from commandeering one.

Darius snapped the reins, sitting on one of the coaches. Given the darkness of the night, the horse was understandably wary of moving too fast through the streets. Especially while pulling one of the smaller carriages. Darius would have preferred leaving the coach behind and taking the horse alone. With his injuries, such a prospect did not seem all that viable.

Nevertheless, he made good time through the city.

The Cliff’s Edge stayover stood tall and bright with glowstone light leaking from its many glass windows. Darius spotted no movement in any of them but that didn’t necessarily mean that nobody saw him approach. The Abbey’s oracles already believed that Arkk possessed a means of scrying. Likely a genuine crystal ball. Not common but not altogether rare either. The inquisition had taken up precautions to avoid scrying but he wasn’t in any position to maintain the spell at the moment.

It didn’t matter if he was seen one way or another. It might cause Arkk to flee but Darius doubted it. Arkk… might not be the most intelligent of people. What could one expect from someone raised in some no-name village? That said, he had enough of a head on his shoulders—not to mention working eyes—to see that Darius wasn’t here to fight. He was in no shape to.

Limping through an utterly deserted lobby, Darius took the stairs one step at a time, grimacing the entire way. It didn’t feel good to be out of breath by the time he reached the floor above. Most of his body didn’t feel good but this was a psychological pain. He really shouldn’t be walking around at all right now. If he injured himself further or even delayed proper healing for too long, it might wind up that the healers wouldn’t be able to do much for him. A permanent limp would have him behind a desk for the remainder of his days. Not at all what he wanted.

Darius stopped at the door he knew to be Arkk’s. He thought about throwing it open. He knew enough combat magic to force a flimsy door and his poor physical condition wouldn’t change that. In the interest of not starting a fight, he instead knocked. Heavy, firm, yet polite enough.

The door swung open far sooner than he expected.

Darius felt his heart skip a beat as his breath caught in his throat. He stared into a pair of burning eyes. Not the burning eyes he had come to discuss but a different, far more familiar set. The faintly glowing scars on Purifier Agnete’s face didn’t twist in rage or surprise. Her messy black hair hung loose around her ears as she quietly regarded him. A dozen spells sprung to Darius’ mind. None made it to his lips. Purifiers were magical abominations that didn’t need lengthy incantations to wield their power. She would incinerate him before he could start.

Licking his lips, Darius put on his best smile. He had been told that his smiles weren’t at all reassuring. It was better than nothing.

“Purifier Agnete,” he said slowly, making sure she knew that he wasn’t casting any spells. “I see you are still alive.”

“Should I not be?” she said, head tilting to one side. Her eyes flicked up and down the hall with the motion, checking for other inquisitors, perhaps.

“I feared that Arkk, in his ignorance, would overuse the Binding Agent. To a catastrophic point.”

Agnete drew in a deep breath and let out a faint sigh of heated air. Having backed up against the wall opposite from the door, there was an entire hallway between them and Darius still felt like he was traipsing through a desert on a particularly dry day. “Your concern is noted but unwarranted. Arkk has not had cause to use it.”

That was an interesting tidbit of information. Agnete could not control herself around fire. Even a little campfire would require monitoring and readying to keep her contained. There were no flames around now but had that been the case for the last several weeks? Or did Arkk’s method of controlling *that* creature extend to Agnete as well?

He pressed his lips into a thin smile, deciding to bring that issue up with his superiors later on. Although they had suspected, knowing for a fact that he had Purifier Agnete working for him alongside the creature from beyond the stars and his cadre of more mundane beings would only make any action against him all the more dangerous. He had quickly grown to be a problem that a single inquisitorial cell couldn’t handle.

Things were going to get… *unpleasant* very quickly.

Unless Darius could do something about it. He honestly didn’t know what. He had come here more out of desperation than because he had a good plan. There was little incentive for Arkk to hand over his secrets or his companions. Threats could only go so far before they had to be enforced—Darius had been the one to screw up that enforcement with the debacle in the Cursed Forest. Nonetheless, he had to try.

“Is Arkk here at present? There are matters of which we must speak. Especially now that his creature has been seen by many.”

“Seen by many?”

“Ah. You haven’t heard. That means he isn’t here,” Darius said with a frown. “Am I right in assuming that he will be here to retrieve you before he leaves the city?”

“I hadn’t heard anything to the contrary,” Agnete said slowly. “Though I am not sure how much information I should be giving away. Familiarity may have caused me to give away too much already despite me being unable to say that I particularly enjoyed working with you.”

“If it makes you feel better, you’ve hardly given anything away that I didn’t already expect or assume. Or realize upon seeing you alive,” Darius added after a moment of thought. “Might I wait for Arkk—”

It turned out there was little need to wait. Several sets of footsteps started climbing the stairs, echoing up the stairwell. A few of the footfalls were heavier than others. An orc, Darius guessed just as the short orc crested the top of the steps. Although far filthier than she had been at the height of the party, Darius recognized her as the orc that had accompanied Arkk. She froze upon spotting him and immediately dropped into a combat stance despite her lack of weaponry.

“What’s—Oh.” Arkk was the next up, quickly followed by the other members of his entourage. And Hawkwood. Darius had encountered the mercenary leader in the past but hadn’t interacted to the point where he would claim to know the man.

Both Arkk and Hawkwood didn’t look like they were in the best shape. Hawkwood kept one arm reaching around his side while Arkk sported linen bandages wrapped around his head.

“Hello, Arkk,” Darius said, eyes shifting over the young man’s shoulder.

The being from beyond the stars stood just a step behind him, hands clasped on Arkk’s arm, supporting him with a demure expression on her face. She was the only one not to look surprised at his presence. He doubted she knew he would be here in advance—nothing the oracles mentioned indicated abilities of prescience—she simply didn’t *care*. The creature’s eyes, burning yellow suns in a black starfield, flicked over him with an utter apathy that even a depressed fairy would fail to match.

“Are we still pretending to be friends?” Arkk asked, far more tense than the monster at his back. “Or are we going to ruin the polished floors with a fight?”

“Please,” Darius said, holding up his hands. His cane dangled limp from one. “I can barely stand. I would very much prefer it if we avoided unnecessary violence. At least tonight.”

Arkk visibly relaxed. Darius had to wonder if he would have believed that from anyone else. Although *he* was genuine, any other enemy of Arkk’s could easily get the man to let his guard down simply by saying what he had. Then again, Darius allowed his eyes to drift over the others in the hall. Tension didn’t bleed out from the orc, Zullie, or even Agnete. Hawkwood, behind his scowl, looked mildly confused but wary of the situation. Even Arkk, on a second glance, didn’t look fully at ease. Darius wasn’t sure that he had ever seen Arkk let his guard down.

And the monster… Darius had seen her handily deal with the assassin that had been targeting the elf. She could emulate a demure expression as much as she wished, her inhuman thoughts and physiology meant that anyone letting their guard down around her would be the king of fools.

“We must speak, Arkk. With your creature having revealed herself—”

“This again?” Arkk said with a sigh. “All that happened tonight and you’re still worried about Vezta? You saw with your own eyes that she harmed nobody but the assassins. I would think that *they* would be a far more pressing issue.”

“I’m sure they are the topic of every conversation going on in the manor this evening,” Darius admitted. “The Duke’s spymaster, especially, will be investigating every one of the staff and checking just how far they might have infiltrated. We all have our duties. Mine lies in containing or controlling esoteric magics before they wreak havoc on the world.”

Darius could feel Agnete stiffening at his side. The rise in temperature wasn’t exactly subtle. He wasn’t even talking about her at the moment. Sweat beaded down the back of Darius’ neck, not all because of the heat. Did Arkk have the Binding Agent on him or had he foolishly left it behind?

“The Inquisition of the Light is the Abbey’s dagger,” Darius said, trying to move the conversation along. “A precision instrument for dealing with issues that arise. It is not the only tool in the Abbey’s arsenal. Carrying on as you are, *flaunting* your monsters in public, and showing blatant disregard for any concealment is going to bring down a force far greater than myself. One you are not going to be able to fend off with a few orcs and a few tricks.”

Arkk closed his eyes and sighed deeply. When he opened them, there was a slight glint that someone less attentive than Darius might have dismissed as a trick of the light. Darius, however, narrowed his eyes, wondering why Arkk had glowing eyes as well.

“One thing after another,” Arkk mumbled. “Thanks for the warning. I appreciate it.”

“Warning?” Darius said, a smile slipping from his face. “Arkk, I don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation. I believe you to be a reasonable man. That is the only reason I am here attempting to reason with you rather than standing back and watching the sword fall on your neck.”

“And I appreciate that. You wanted me to hand over Vezta and some object that doesn’t even exist that allows me to control her. That will never happen. If you know me half as well as you think you do, you would already know that.”

Darius sighed. “I do,” he said slowly.

“I imagine you would want Agnete back as well?”

“It wasn’t confirmed that you kept her alive.” Darius glanced to his side. “Confirmation will only increase the severity of the situation.”

“Then don’t confirm it. You’re the only one who knows, right?”

“You can’t ask that of me.”

“I am.”

“Even if I did, the oracles would discover the truth eventually.”

“As long as it buys us time. I know we aren’t friends or allies… or even like each other, but you said you trusted me. Right now, I think I need to use some of that trust.”

“You’re stretching my words far beyond what I intended, Arkk.”

“You know I’m not some maniacal villain bent on destroying the universe—or whatever you think Vezta represents. So I’m asking you to buy me time. Tell your superiors that I’m coming around to what you’re saying or that you think I’ll join them. Whatever it takes to get them off my back for just a little longer.”

“Why would I ever agree to that?” Darius asked, tone flat.

“Because war approaches.” It wasn’t Arkk who answered, but Hawkwood. The mercenary leader stepped forward, shoulders broad and back straight despite a grimace on his face. “Master Inquisitor, you might not know me but I am the head of White Company.”

“I’m aware.”

“After the events of the evening, White Company might be the only large free company with its leadership still intact. This war isn’t a far-off thing. It is happening now.”

Arkk held out a hand. A crystal ball appeared in his grip, the image within shifting and changing. Curious despite himself, Darius approached enough to see within. It took him a moment to realize what he was seeing. Rows upon rows of soldiers marched past a high plateau, trudging through the darkness with only a handful of torches to light their way.

“They’re already at our borders,” Arkk said. “I have an employee there who contacted me in the middle of all the chaos this evening.”

“Are they mad?” Darius couldn’t help but ask. “It’s the start of winter!”

“They must think they can weather it,” Hawkwood said. “Or perhaps they don’t care about their soldiers. Whatever the case, they are half a day out from Moonshine Burg. I’ve dispatched Swiftwings to rally White Company. It will be up to us to buy time while the rest of the nation puts itself back together.”

“Company Al-Mir isn’t exactly at a size where we can fight in a war but we do have specialists and… esoteric magics. We can help, but not if I’ve got to fight off the Abbey of the Light and their misconceptions about my employees and companions.”

“Readying White Company won’t be possible before they arrive,” Hawkwood said. “Moonshine Burg has strong walls and should have full storehouses of food. They can last a seige… *If* tonight’s incident was any indication, this has been in the planning for some time. I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that Moonshine Burg’s leadership has been taken out already and the gate guards replaced with agents who will keep the gates open for the invaders.” He took a deep breath. “No matter what we do, they *will* have a stronghold inside our borders by this time tomorrow. I don’t know if they plan to stop there for the winter or march through it.” He paused and glanced at Arkk. “With the Duchy in disarray, we need all the help we can get.”

“Did the Duke survive?” Arkk asked.

“He did.”

Arkk schooled his features but not before letting a flicker of disappointment through. He nodded his head. “I see.”

“He’ll need to be made aware of this,” Hawkwood said, giving Darius a pointed expression. “I would myself but I’ve got a war to run. Arkk promised transportation to White Company’s nearest stronghold.”

Arkk nodded. “Vezta, get everything ready. Send Zullie through first. Zullie,” he said, turning. “I want a progress report by morning. And I want to hear *good* news.”

The witch rolled her eyes. “Lovely. Staying awake all night after what we went through?”

“You stay awake every night anyway, don’t you?”

“Doesn’t mean I wanted to stay up tonight,” she grumbled.

“Master, is me leaving your side the wisest action given current circumstances?”

Darius shifted uncomfortably. Agnete represented a very real threat of a fiery death. She was still *human*, however. This creature barely looked at him. When she did, her eyes disregarded him so thoroughly that he felt utterly irrelevant in her presence. It was a wonder anyone else here could stand being under that gaze for long.

Then again, she didn’t look at *Arkk* like he was irrelevant. Perhaps ascribing emotions to such an inhuman being was wrong but he *felt* like there was an undercurrent of fanatical obsession hidden in those fields of stars.

Arkk didn’t notice or had grown used to it. “You’re the fastest at crafting ritual circles and we’ll need a lot before the night is over. Don’t worry. I can handle a crippled inquisitor on my own,” he said with an easy smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Not that I think Vrox intends any harm toward me.”

Darius frowned at the implied question. “I already said that I am not here to fight.”

“And calling the church down on me?”

“You’re playing a dangerous game here. Nothing can be hidden from the oracles for long. It is just a matter of them finding the right question to ask.”

“As long as it buys some time. Enough for other, more qualified mercenary companies and the Duke’s Grand Guard to get back on their feet.”

Darius remained silent for a long moment, thinking. This… He knew what Arkk was like. Everything he had learned about the man pointed toward this being an utterly and quite pathetically *genuine* attempt to help the nation at large. He wanted a stay of execution, not to escape but to help as best he could. It…

It was enough to make Darius laugh. He *didn’t*. He had more self-control than that. Still… Drawing in a breath, Darius spoke slowly, “I will file my report. If the chaos of the evening means it gets lost for a short time, then I suppose that is simply bad luck.”

Arkk put on a smile, wide and genuine. For a moment, it almost looked like he wanted to clap a hand onto Darius’ shoulder. He managed to restrain himself.

“Vezta, after you get Zullie and Hawkwood situated, get Dakka to the plateau.” Arkk turned to the orc. “I don’t know why an army would be interested in a tiny flopkin community, but let them know that we can house them if they feel in danger. Then both of you and Agnete get to Katja’s encampment. Let her know what is going on, offer asylum as well. We *need* her mages. If she declines…” He looked from Vezta to Agnete and back. “Well, don’t take no for an answer.”

“And you, Master?”

Arkk drew in a deep breath. “I don’t want to leave Ilya…”

“She survived,” Darius offered. “The healers are tending to her at the behest of… her mother, I presume.”

“I know.” He grimaced before hefting the crystal ball. “Scrying is handy. Her mother is doing well, is she? She is at her side.”

Darius didn’t react. Scrying on the Duke’s manor shouldn’t have been possible. It was as protected—if not more—as a temple. With its wards raised because of the attack, there shouldn’t have been any way to get magical information past its walls. Arkk had said that he received a cry for help in the middle of the attack as well, hadn’t he? Had that been before the alarm went up or after?

Darius nodded his head, filing the dangerous information away for later. They already knew of Arkk’s dive into esoteric magic. It was good to know capabilities but the fact itself wasn’t surprising.

“If I am headed back to alert the Duke to this invasion, would you like me to pass on a message?”

Arkk grimaced again, likely not favoring the idea of relying on someone that he wasn’t all that enthused with. “Tell her not to worry. I won’t leave her there. Let her know what is going on as well, if you would.”

“Very well.” Darius drew in a deep breath.

“Thank you. Vezta.”

“Understood, Master.”

Darius shifted away as the creature walked right past him without a second glance. Or… maybe it was staring at him the entire time. With her back to him, he had to take his eyes off her face and promptly found an oddity running down her spine, dark fields spreading the white of her outfit apart with glowing yellow eyes staring out.

Shuddering, Darius moved past Arkk only to pause. “Arkk.”

“Yes?”

“You went after that assassin.”

“Naturally.”

“Is it? I doubt many men would put themselves in danger like that. They would rather leave it to the guards to handle.”

Arkk simply shrugged.

“You didn’t succeed in stopping him.”

The casual shrug shifted as his shoulders slackened. “Can’t win them all.”

“Well, for what it is worth, I hope you and Hawkwood win this one. Don’t betray my trust.”

Arkk’s smile turned a little more brittle than Darius would have liked. With all the vague threats, Darius couldn’t exactly call that unexpected. Still, he kept it in mind as he descended the Cliff’s Edge stairwell one step at a time.

## 74 - Aftermath of the Duke's Party - Sule


The last rays of a peaceful sun set over the Evestani Sultanate. When the sun next shined down, it would be stained with the blood of war.

Sule, Sultan of Evestani, sat with his legs crossed atop an oversized chair. Below him, two rows of young women leaned over shallow bowls of water placed in front of each, listening to the ripples. Every few moments, one would lean back, babble a few incoherent words, then lean back over their bowl. An interpreter, sitting in the center of the room at a circular table, would then spin in his chair until he found the book he was looking for, scan through it, and scribble down his best guess on a thick tablet.

After managing to make something coherent, the interpreter handed the tablet to Zarkov.

Sule, fingers drumming on the armrest of his chair betraying his nervousness, watched the Grand Vizier’s reactions.

The doors to the chamber slammed open, striking the wall hard enough to shake dust from the rafters. The closest row of listeners let out identical screams as the waters in their bowls rippled from the sudden shock. One fell forward, face splashing into the water. Zarkov had to maneuver around the central table to pull the listener back before she could drown in the shallow puddle.

Sule’s eyes shifted, looking to the door as his second daughter stormed inside, golden dress billowing in her wake.

“Kala tells me you sent assassins after my husband.”

“General Kala speaks too much for her own good,” Sule said. His drumming fingers stopped as he frowned at his furious daughter. “And you have no husband. You were never married. You are no longer *engaged*.”

Mihra’s fingers curled around the fabric of her dress, crushing it in a slowly tightening grip. “Is this because *I* chose it? To get away from you? Alya and I had *plans*, we were going—”

“This has nothing to do with you, Mihra,” Sule said, speaking in a defeated tone as he closed his eyes. “Nor that *elf*.”

He would like to lay all his problems at the feet of that elf but, truthfully, he couldn’t. In fact, Sule had been quite supportive of their endeavor. Anything to help keep things going as they had been.

Thirty years ago, Sultan Mehmed’s untimely death brought a messy and chaotic end to the war against the Kingdom of Chernlock. The *fighting* hadn’t ended, however. With no heir, Evestani fell into a civil war with the regular citizens getting caught between a trio of generals, the former vizier, and… well, Sule himself.

As a mere civil administrator, Sule had tried keeping the people he could safe. Lacking a proper military, it hadn’t been easy. They were farmers, craftsmen, and the general working peoples of Evestani. That included some old veterans, enough to form a militia of their own to protect what farmland they could. And that was the extent of their power. They had been able to do little more than protect themselves as the rest of the nation tore themselves apart.

Help came from an unexpected source. An elf, bearing gifts of supplies, food, weapons, and even people from the very nation the former sultan had tried to crush under his expansionist heel. All given freely so long as *he* was the one to come out of the civil war on top.

Sule had. And now he was here, betraying that gift.

Sule’s eyes drifted away from his upset daughter to the *other* man in the room. A man wreathed in golden light with darker skin and short, light hair. Literally *light*. It looked as if the man had implanted tiny amber glowstones all along his scalp. He sat in a small wooden chair, head tipped back and eyes closed as if he were asleep.

“Father—”

The golden man’s eyes slowly opened. Just a crack. Just enough to cast his cheeks in a thin sliver of white light.

“Guards!” Sule said, standing before his daughter could continue speaking. A pair of soldiers entered the room, having been posted just outside. “Escort Mihra back to her room. She is distraught.”

“Distraught? Damn right, I’m—Unhand me you—”

“Daughter. Return to your room. We will discuss this later.”

Brown eyes *glared* as Mihra struggled against the hands on her upper arms. Her fingers nearly tore a hole in her dress as she clenched her fists. All at once, the motion stopped and an odd calm crossed her face. “And you wonder why Razie vanished without a word. Unhand me! I can walk on my own,” she *snarled* as she shoved the guards aside. Her dress trailed behind her as she stormed out of the room.

One of the guards looked at him, offering a small shrug. Sule barely saw it as he sank back into his chair, elbow hitting the armrest as his hand covered his eyes. Hearing his first daughter’s name in a situation like this… He would have to post other guards. Make sure no one else disappeared before he had a chance to explain things.

But first, he had a monster to please.

“Zarkov,” Sule said, voice low and firm. “Is it done?”

The Grand Vizier, looking up from a fresh sheet of interpretations, raised an arched eyebrow. He stroked his light-brown beard with two fingers. “Done? Sultan, we are only beginning.”

Sule drew in a breath, throwing his gaze up toward the ceiling for a brief moment. “Not in the mood for your theatrics, Zarkov.”

“Apologies, Sultan,” Zarkov said, sweeping an arm under his chest as he bowed. “We have successfully taken Moonshine Burg. Their storehouses are ours.”

“That was never in question,” Sule said with a glare. “What of the *Duke*?”

“The Duke… yet lives. Along with the elf.”

Sule’s eyes shifted to the corner of the room where the man wreathed in a golden light sat. He didn’t move a muscle at the disappointing news. His eyes were once again closed. Not allowing himself a small sigh of relief, Sule turned his attention back to Zarkov as the vizier began to speak.

“The assassins were able to take out a majority of the targets. However, it seems they were interrupted by a rather interesting individual right in the middle of the Duke’s party. A man with glowing red eyes accompanied by a monster of indescribable horror.”

The man in the corner of the room stood slowly, eyes opening fully to flood the room with a glowing golden light. Sule wilted under his gaze.

“It’s her,” he said, voice reverberating as if a dozen of him were speaking as one. “The last one has finally found a new master. The stars are shifting once again.” Stepping forward, he held out his hand toward Zarkov.

The Grand Vizier, holding only the interpreted notes, quickly handed them over before stepping back with a bowed head.

Sule wasn’t sure the man even noticed the sudden nervousness with which Zarkov moved. The man’s eyes shifted ever so subtly, casting light on the pages as he read. With teeth looking like finely cut glowstones, the man smiled.

“We will still them.”

***

Sule paced in front of the door to his daughter’s chambers. Though the evening had been stressful enough and he wanted nothing more than to huddle up in his room, trying to avoid thinking about anything that was going on, the upcoming week was not going to be any better. He had to get this done tonight. It had been left to fester for too long as it was.

The Palace of the Sultan wasn’t a particularly large or grandiose building. The original had been destroyed in the civil war and, when Sule came out ahead, he hadn’t wanted to rebuild it to be something overly opulent. Not at a time when the people of the country needed to focus on *their* rebuilding efforts. Its construction hadn’t even started until eight years ago, well after the war had ended and he had been sure that shelter and food had been fully secured for Evestani. Nonetheless, it still stood tall on its hill with a great number of rooms for family, workers, visitors, and servants.

He had hoped it would be a guiding light into how Evestani handled itself in the future. An example of balance between the ruling class and the people’s needs, a far cry from the original *Mumthaz* which had been built with gold and precious gemstones covering its rounded ceilings and tall spires.

Now he stood outside his daughter’s door, trying to decide how to explain that the future he had envisioned had all crumbled to dust.

“Mihra? Are you there?” he called through the door.

His daughter didn’t respond. Knowing her, he would have been surprised if she had. Especially after ordering the guards to drag her away. It had been for her safety but he well knew that was just an excuse. If anything, he was surprised that she hadn’t thrown a shoe against the door in response.

“Things have been complicated as of late,” he said in a half-sigh, leaning against the door’s frame. “The Golden Order has… Well, there’s a great evil threatening…” Sule closed his eyes, leaning his head back before deciding to focus on one particular thing she had said earlier. “Your elder sister, Razie, left because there were some things she didn’t agree with. She didn’t vanish without any words to me. Rather, it was more because of how many words she had for me that she felt she couldn’t stay any longer.

“Razie is a headstrong girl who never felt right smiling and accepting the people’s adoration. Skilled and talented, she always felt people only saw her because she was the princess and not because of her personal feats and accomplishments. In contrast to you, she never took well to being called a princess and when the prospect of political marriages came up, we had extensive arguments…”

Sule paused, waiting to see if his second daughter would say anything. He wasn’t even sure if she was still awake. Meetings and plans, organizations and generals, and the *Golden Order* had consumed the majority of the night. There was so much to do and so much he *couldn’t* delegate to others.

“Though her absence pains me, she didn’t *up and vanish* as you might suspect. It was the prospect of being married to a count in the Tetrarchy that truly infuriated her. When the prospect of marriage to Duke Woldair first came up with regards to you, I had expected the same, honestly. Marrying off any of my daughters to a *pig* like the Duke made *me* ill at ease. I had hoped you would object as well.”

“But you didn’t. Then the Golden Order came to me and I tried to make you see reason, to see the Duke for what he was and that *elf* for the puppeteer she is…” Sule opened his eyes, looking around the hall. There were certain things that he shouldn’t say. Especially not out in the open like this. It had been made readily apparent that, despite his station as Sultan, he was *not* a necessary component of this country.

His eventual replacement should he leave the throne vacant, a figurehead though they might be, was an unknown. Would they try to shield the people as much as they could from the consequences of the Golden Order’s actions? Or would they revel in the chaos as the warlords of old Evestani had? He couldn’t *let* someone else take the power. Not if Evestani wanted to continue.

“Mihra, might I come in?” Sule asked after another long stretch of silence. He tapped his knuckles against the wood of the door. When the silence continued, a small pit of worry fell into the back of his stomach. “Mihra?” he called, knocking harder. “I’m coming in, Mihra.”

Grasping the door’s handle, he shoved into the door. It opened a handspan before getting caught on something. He shoved his shoulder into it again and again, pushing it open a little more each time until whatever was on the other side gave way. A chair clattered to the ground as the door swung open.

“Mihra?” Sule called, stepping into the dark room. The glowstones in the lamps were missing. Taken. He charged past the books and shelves, into the bedroom proper, only to freeze.

The bed was empty, with thin sheets lying atop a flat mattress. The window, open to the night, clattered against the wall in a heavy gust of wind. Sule rushed over, peering out into the night. “Mihra!” he called. The bushes down below looked like something might have landed in them. A foolish daughter, perhaps. That daughter was nowhere to be seen.

“Guards!” Sule called, turning. “Guard—”

He froze as a younger man entered his daughter’s quarters, eyes glowing a brilliant gold.

“Y… Your Holiness…”

The man’s eyes shined their light around the room as he took it in, though his face betrayed an utter absence of emotion. “Sultan,” he said eventually, even offering a respectful bow. Sule didn’t believe in its genuineness for a moment. “Is something wrong?”

“It’s… my daughter. She has fled the palace.”

“Is that a problem?” the man asked, head tilting to one side as if he couldn’t understand the reason Sule was even making noise with his mouth.

“Problem? Of course, it’s—”

“Will it affect our operations?”

“I—” Sule’s jaw clamped shut as the man’s golden eyes turned to face him fully. He suppressed a shudder but couldn’t help the step back, bumping into the ledge of the window. Swallowing, he tried to smile. “No. No, it won’t.”

“Good. Then in light of the information we have received this evening, I think it would be prudent to accelerate our advance into the Duchy.”

“Advance? We’re already marching *into* winter. How much…” Sule trailed off, realizing just how little the man cared for anything he was saying. “Sorry, Your Holiness. I… What kind of advancement were you thinking?”

“I am glad you asked. Come along,” he said, turning back to the door.

Now that the golden light had turned away from Sule, he drew in a shuddering breath. He glanced back over his shoulder and made a decision.

He would *not* look for his daughter. Either of them. Though it pained him, getting away from the palace was perhaps the safest thing they could have done, even if they didn’t know it. He could only hope that Mihra would find her elder sister out there somewhere and they could support each other.

“Sultan?”

Sule jolted and hurried along, leaving the vacant bedroom behind.
