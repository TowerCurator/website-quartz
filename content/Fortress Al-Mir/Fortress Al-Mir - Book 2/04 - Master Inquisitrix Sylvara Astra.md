Arkk did his best to look at ease as the heavy portcullis over Elmshadow Burg’s western gate lifted.

Everything was prepared. Everything was planned for.

He stood alongside Hawkwood, the latter having been informed of Arkk’s suspicions. In the eaves, lurking in the dark and vacant homes near to the burg’s entrance, Hawkwood had positioned his finest marksmen, supposedly capable of striking an apple at a hundred paces with their crossbows. A full contingent of wary guards stood behind, sporting White Company’s chevrons, alongside a smaller company of orcs with Company Al-Mir’s compass maze insignia hidden behind chevrons as well. Two pairs of gorgon, one to petrify and one to free the other if their magic ended up turned on themselves, haunted the guardhouse, ready to strike.

Agnete, though not wishing to make herself known to the possible inquisitors or their purifier equivalent, nonetheless burned hot at Arkk’s back, wearing concealing armor on loan from one of Hawkwood’s men.

If these were inquisitors, Arkk hoped they would appreciate the precautions in the face of possible danger. If they were assassins…

He hoped they would be surprised.

The woman strode forward ahead of the others, her black uniform bearing the inquisitorial eye, golden regalia of the Abbey of the Light, and the blue and white striped shield of the Duke. Vrox didn’t wear the latter two. Was that a clue? An adjustment made for wartime? Or inconsequential difference in uniform? Her long silver-blue hair flowed over her chest from underneath her peaked cap. Red eyes beneath the brim looked over the welcoming party like hardened steel with little obvious concern.

They were, thankfully, not *glowing* red eyes. The color was common to dark elves and gremlins. Given the average height and lack of pointed ears, Arkk figured that she had ancestry of one of the two, maybe three generations back at most.

A rapid, excited clapping pulled Arkk’s attention away from the leader of the group. “Oh! Are you going to play with us?” The man who had been creating those statue-swallowing spheres let out a childish giggle. “Please say yes. I so rarely get to meet new friends and, when I do, *pop!* They’re gone.” His laughter cut out, leaving behind a sorry moan of disappointment. The way the grin never left his face and his wide, black eyes kept darting from soldier to soldier didn’t do anything to set Arkk at ease.

A mere glare over her shoulder from the lead inquisitor was enough to get the man to lock up. His back stiffened, the heels of his boots clicked together, and beads of sweat even started rolling down his pale face.

Arkk wondered for a moment if he was also on some kind of leash, much as Agnete had been. The ice marble, referred to as a Binding Agent, caused extreme pain and duress, even evoking a fight or flight instinct that leaned toward the latter since it stripped her ability to generate flames. A fleeting thought of recruiting this man out from under the inquisitors, the same way he had recruited Agnete, crossed Arkk’s mind.

One look into the man’s maniacal eyes, which regained their fervor the moment the woman looked away, made Arkk shut that idea down. Although he had recruited criminals and raiders, Arkk was confident that none were quite so… zealous.

“You are Company Commander Hawkwood?” she asked, striding forward without so much as a glance at the array of defenders in front of the gate.

At least, not until everyone shifted, readying weapons. Her gait stalled as she slowly turned her head, sweeping her gaze over the assembled group. Her arms remained down at her sides, stiff but well away from the narrow sword’s hilt at her hip.

“I apologize for the rude meeting,” Hawkwood said with a smile that failed to reach his eyes. “But there are some mighty suspicious happenings around these parts. An inquisitor showing up out of the blue—”

“Inquisitrix,” she corrected, gaze returning to Hawkwood. “Master Inquisitrix Sylvara Astra.”

“I’m sure those fancy titles make a number of men bow out of your way but *I’m* going to need some proof of identity.”

Astra pursed her lips before glancing back over her *other* shoulder. “Ludwig.”

The gaunt man with a long, narrow face stepped forward, reaching into a leather bag at his side.

“Chronicler Qwol will see to your needs.”

The chronicler pulled out a few fine pieces of paper as he approached. Intricate scrawl, written with golden ink, adorned the pages. Arkk’s eyes focused on the top center where the Luminous Mandala, the primary symbol of the Abbey of the Light, sat. Normally, it was simplified to a series of concentric rings. This piece of paper had the full version, a harmonious blend of geometric precision and ethereal elegance. It appeared as a sunburst filled with a lattice-like pattern, rings following rays of represented light as they spread outward.

To either side were the lesser regalia of the Abbey of the Light. Icons that represented the Heart of Gold and the Almighty Glory, according to Vezta. Arkk ignored them for the moment, eyes roaming up to the intricate pendant hanging from the chronicler’s neck, a simplified representation of the Luminous Mandala. It was identical to the one Greesom wore, further validating their claims. Were it not for Agnete, Arkk might have taken the papers, the outfits, and the pendant would have convinced him.

Hawkwood shot Arkk a glance and nodded his head. The information on the papers looked legitimate.

He handed it back but, before Qwol could place the document back in the leather bag, Hawkwood gripped his wrist. “Authenticate it.”

The chronicler’s eyes jumped up his forehead. He glanced back, wordlessly asking Astra a question. The woman’s hard eyes narrowed but she nodded her head.

Arkk tensed, ready to fling a lightning bolt when the assassins revealed themselves, only to deflate entirely as the chronicler grabbed the pendant from his neck and overlaid it atop the Luminous Mandala on the piece of paper. A warm, white glow coursed through the symbol, flowing over to the letters as well.

They were genuine.

“Satisfied?” Astra asked, one hand on her hip.

Hawkwood, frowning behind his messy beard, released Chronicler Qwol. “I apologize, Inquisitrix. Evestani has a penchant for using disguised assassins. Your timing and direction of approach are suspicious.”

Astra turned again, glaring at the horizon. If looks could kill… She turned back with a more thoughtful expression beneath the brim of her peaked cap.

“So…” The man with black eyes slumped his shoulders. “No games today?”

“Quite. I suppose it is your lucky day, Hawkwood. We were in the area pursuing an… unrelated target.”

Arkk shifted, wondering if that referred to him, Agnete, or something else.

“Purifier Tybalt felt the touch of forbidden magics,” she continued without even looking in his direction. “We followed his instinct to the animated constructs.”

“Those were my men,” Hawkwood said, rough voice cracking at the end of the sentence. He licked his lips, taking a moment to recenter himself. “Struck by enchanted arrows of the Evestani army. We… I had hoped we could find a way to return them to normal.”

Astra glanced to the chronicler, who shook his narrow head. “It is the opinion of the Light that such magic could not be undone. Your men died. Take solace in knowing they are no longer a threat to their fellows anymore.”

Arkk spoke before he could help himself. “What did you do with them?” he asked, only to grimace as everyone’s attention turned to him. Now knowing that these were true inquisitors and not assassins, he should have just left and let them handle everything. But this was new magic. Even beyond his personal interest, knowing what might face him and Agnete should the inquisitors turn out to be less friendly than Vrox felt vital. The sudden attention still made him balk. “I just… thought purifiers used holy flames.”

“They have been *detained*,” the purifier exclaimed with an overabundance of ardor in his voice. “They shall await the end, safe and sound until the stars dim with not but the void for company!”

Astra snapped her fingers, making the purifier flinch back. “Ignore him. He is disturbed.”

“All stars will burn out eventually,” Purifier Tybalt said, shrinking in on himself. A small smile spread across his face as he looked at his leader. “Some sooner than others.”

“Rest assured,” Astra said, ignoring his words, “their existence no longer concerns this reality.”

Arkk tried to keep his expression as neutral as possible. Two words among everything said since his question stuck out to him. *Detained* and *Void*. One of the statues at the Fortress Al-Mir temple room was the Jailor of the Void. The patron of time, eternity, and emptiness. The one statue that Vezta had been unable to explain why it might have manifested.

If this purifier was like Agnete, an avatar of the old Pantheon, Arkk had a feeling he knew to which god he owed his abilities. Did that help anything? Not necessarily right now. Perhaps it would make it easier to find a countermeasure or at least figure out all that he could do.

“As for holy flames… Three purifiers wield them. They are flashy, obvious, and destructive. It is hardly a surprise that rumors have spread that *all* purifiers utilize fire.”

Arkk resisted the urge to look back at Agnete. He felt he had a better source than mere rumors. Then again, she had said that she didn’t know all that many inquisitors.

“You said this is my lucky day,” Hawkwood said, drawing attention back to him. “Sure doesn’t feel like it.”

“Our hunt has stalled. Given our purview and the Golden Order’s usage of anathematic magics, it is well within our rights to assist in breaking this siege.” She paused, leaning over to the chronicler as the gaunt man started whispering at her side. “Ah yes. We also wish to inquire about those… skulls surrounding the valley. They ran off our horses.”

“You didn’t destroy them, did you?” Hawkwood asked, alarmed. “Those are the only things keeping Evestani at bay.”

“Not yet.” Her eyes hardened. “You constructed them?”

After letting out a brief sigh of relief, Hawkwood shook his head. “A colleague. He said he had a way of protecting the area. I didn’t ask. Learned it is generally better not to when he is involved.”

Arkk pressed his lips together, eying Hawkwood. He most certainly *had* asked. He hadn’t been too approving of using the dead, even if the skulls were from ancient barrows. That was how people got themselves cursed, he said. Quite a similar sentiment to Edvin’s concerns.

“This colleague being Arkk of Company Al-Mir?”

Arkk stiffened at the mention of his name, only to realize that none of the three were looking in his direction.

“You know him?”

“*Of* him. He is a person of interest.”

“The target of your hunt?” Hawkwood said, asking the question Arkk had wondered earlier.

“No. We seek one roaming the skies. A dragonoid was spotted in the area. I don’t suppose your scouts have any information for us on the matter?”

Hawkwood started, as did Arkk. “In the Duchy? Did Evestani bring it?”

“Unsure. Thus far, we’ve had no reports of it attacking anyone. Given the information troubles with the war, that is only a matter of time. Our goal was to detain it.”

Detain. There was that word again. Judging by the gleeful look in Purifier Tybalt’s eyes, he doubted they meant to detain it in any regular cell. Which wasn’t all that surprising. Dragonoids were something of an enigma. Not dragons, though related to them to the point where their armored scales made them nearly indestructible to any conventional weaponry and normal magics. They possessed natural magics akin to beastmen but on a far greater scale. A flame dragonoid might give Agnete a run for her money in terms of destructive prowess. If a dragonoid and Agnete were to fight, Arkk doubted he would put his money on his employee. Agnete was still a fleshy human behind her fires.

If Evestani was fielding dragonoids, the war might already be over. They just didn’t know it yet. It was said that dragonoids were hostile to almost every human. However, he wouldn’t put it past the Golden Order, backed by a member of the Pantheon, to have a way of controlling them.

“Well, I’m afraid we can’t help with that. Your assistance with the siege will be appreciated. We planned to hold out for the Duke’s men to arrive, projected to be in about four day’s time, and then use the reinforcements to turn the tides once—”

“Sir!” One of the gate guards leaned over the top wall, waving one of the spyglasses. “Movement on the horizon! A large force is approaching!”

Arkk’s eyes widened. He looked down at the inquisitors, still half expecting them to reveal their treachery and attack. When they didn’t, he had to confirm. “You didn’t destroy the mausoleums, correct?”

Red eyes centered on him once again. This time, she was more discerning, looking over him for a long moment even as Hawkwood started barking out orders to his men. Positions needed to be taken up, defenses raised, spellcasters on alert for falling arrows, and reserves woken. The purifier turned around, eagerly looking out Elmshadow’s gate. At Arkk’s back, he felt the chill of the winter air vanish as the heat escaped Agnete’s concealing armor.

Master Inquisitrix Sylvara Astra merely regarded Arkk with an uncanny calm. She leaned over and whispered something to the chronicler, who turned his half-lidded eyes onto Arkk as well. He didn’t say anything back, however, merely watching as well until Astra spoke.

“I believe I said that I did not. And you would be..?”

“My adjutant, Tavyn,” Hawkwood said, looking to Arkk. “Have you got your crystal ball?”

Arkk nodded his head, mumbling thanks to Hawkwood as he turned away from the inquisitors. Back to them, he summoned the crystal ball to his waiting hand while acting like Agnete was handing it to him. Turning back around, he held it up while pushing magic into it.

Whatever magic the Evestani had used to cloak themselves from his prior scrying attempts must have only worked while they were stationary. The army was marching forward, just barely reaching the point where the mausoleums should have sent them fleeing in terror. He saw the line in the front flinch, perhaps even losing their grip on their weapons. A golden light, emanating from the bald Pious of the Golden Order that each company counted among their number, suffused throughout the advancing soldiers.

Whatever they were doing wasn’t a perfect solution. More than a handful broke ranks and fled. The rest of the army didn’t try to stop them. They simply continued forward until the first company reached the closest set of mausoleums. As soon as they did, they started hacking and beating, using horseman’s picks to chip away at the stone the lesser servants had constructed. When the first of the mausoleums fell, the vanguard lifted their weapons in cheer, emboldening the other companies as they started hacking at the rest of the defensive line.

“It appears our time is limited,” Inquisitrix Astra said, having stepped closer to peer in alongside Hawkwood and Arkk. “What will it be, White Company? Admit us entry to assist or continue this…” She trailed off, allowing a snide grin to cross her face. “This *inquisition*.”

Arkk shared a look with Hawkwood. He wasn’t completely convinced. They still hadn’t heard a proper explanation about why the inquisitors had approached from the direction of Evestani. Arkk felt like it was even more suspicious now. What if those golden statues had been a threat to their own side, willing to lash out at anyone and not just Hawkwood’s men? It could be that these inquisitors cleared them away and still had a plot to assassinate everyone here, just in time to open the gates for the approaching army.

Then again, the inquisitor’s papers had checked out just as Agnete had said they would. Not only that, but Agnete hadn’t touched his back. That was supposed to have been the sign that she noticed something fishy with their authentication.

After a brief hesitation, Arkk nodded his head. He wouldn’t be leaving Hawkwood alone with them, that was for sure. The current crisis warranted risks. Elmshadow couldn’t handle those golden arrows raining down upon it. Once the Duke’s Guard arrived, they would present additional targets for those golden arrows, at least until informed of and secured against the danger. With Agnete only able to melt the ground to pacify the golden statues, having a purifier on hand who could *detain* them sounded almost necessary.

Hawkwood frowned behind his mustache, clearly displeased. He likely had the same thoughts and had been hoping that Arkk would shake his head, giving him an easy out. But he hadn’t. Thus, Hawkwood turned back.

“Get inside. I’d welcome you to Elmshadow but it wouldn’t be much of a welcome,” he said before tilting his head back. “Seal the gate!”

“I’ll keep an eye on them,” Arkk said in a low whisper. Astra probably heard but Arkk didn’t much care. She didn’t react one way or another.

“We are specialists, not generals,” Astra said. “I will defer to your expertise. Direct us where you will but know that we will not follow orders that sound like they will lead to unnecessary deaths.”

“Right,” Hawkwood said, voice gruff as the portcullis slammed down. “Let me get my men in order, then I’d best find out more about your capabilities to know where to place you.”

He turned and started marching through the assembled troops, shouting an order to one of his *actual* adjutants as he moved. Arkk made a quick motion to Agnete, warning her away. The woman was getting too hot—she would be found out in an instant if her armor started glowing red. As it was, he thanked the chaos and the crowd that her heat hadn’t been noticed thus far.

As soon as she turned, heading toward the contingent of orcs that weren’t following along with the rest of White Company’s men, Arkk hurried after Hawkwood. As he moved, he watched his back the same way he had while blindfolded in the Silver City mines, making sure that the inquisitors following behind weren’t about to launch a surprise attack.

Siege or not, he wasn’t about to let Hawkwood go anywhere alone with these people.
