The elevator in the Projects Apartment Complex wasn’t always reliable. It was a complicated contraption. Filled with brass pipes that leaked sticky black tar, red-handled valve wheels, levers from floor to ceiling, and clear glass pipes filled with a violet gas that occasionally had bolts of lightning surging through it. There were more toggles and flashing lights than could actually fit inside the elevator. Indicators came in long glass tubes filled with metal meshes that glowed an angry orange when lit up. They didn’t use numbers or letters that I could understand and the symbols seemed to be different every day of the week.

I honestly wasn’t sure what normal elevators looked like. I knew this wasn’t a normal elevator, but it was also the only one I had ever seen. At least, the only one I could remember seeing.

It was a good thing that I didn’t often have to operate it on my own.

I wasn’t quite sure when it had happened—I used to have to operate the lift on my own—but at some point, that leaking black tar from the elevator pipes gained sapience. It didn’t want to leave the elevator, or do much of anything it seemed, but it did like to push the buttons in the elevator.

Stepping inside, I smiled and nodded at the slop of black sludge. “Sixth floor please.”

It bubbled and gurgled in response. Being a being that came from the elevator, it knew how to work it better than most. A slimy tendril snapped out, pulling a toggle switch down. Another tendril hit a button I had never noticed before. A spinning wheel closed the elevator doors and a pull of a hanging wire sounded the elevator whistle.

With that, the elevator began chugging along.

I took a seat on the bench. It normally took between two minutes and three hours to reach my floor. I had heard murmurs from other tenants of the Projects Apartment Complex complaining about the time it took to get anywhere, but I didn’t mind. I didn’t have much to get back to in my apartment. This provided plenty of time to read my book.

About halfway to my floor, a trail of black sludge dragged a cart up the aisles between the elevator benches. On top of the cart, there were a number of confections, pastries, and delights. Freshly cooked every day, or so I had heard.

It stopped at me.

Slipping a thick rubber glove over my hands, I looked over the assortment of goodies. “Just a butter crisp cookie today, I think.”

I dropped a few coins into the old bean can the sludge held out for me and then held out my hands.

Thick black sludge slapped against my hands and then stayed there. I could barely see a perfectly cooked butter cookie between the strands of tar. “Thanks,” I said, not wanting to be impolite.

The Lift Engineer bubbled and gurgled in response before continuing along the aisle.

I scraped the cookie and accompanying slime into a little plastic bag and then used some sterilizing wipes on my gloves. The wipes went into the plastic bag as well.

As good as they looked on the cart, I had never eaten one.

I had seen someone eat one once. Glancing back over my shoulder at one of the many other benches in the elevator, I could still see them. Or at least, I could see their dessicated skeleton and slime-eaten rotten meat. Around the jaw and nose of the skill, the sternum of the ribcage, and their spine behind where their stomach had once been, black tar had eaten straight through the bone.

The arrival whistle had me putting down my book. I gathered up my things and, after the elevator doors slid open, I exited the elevator with a polite nod and wave to the pile of gurgling gunk.

As soon as the elevator doors shut behind me, I turned to the waste basket that sat just outside the elevator doors and dropped the plastic bag inside. The waste basket licked its lips and let out a rumbling belch as I walked to my room.
