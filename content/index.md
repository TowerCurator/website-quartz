### Synopsis
Ancient legends tell of a time where magic was plentiful, gods walked alongside mortals, and monsters lurked in every shadow. A time of romance and a time of war. A time where empires stretched to the skies.

Arkk lives in far more mundane times. Residing within an obscure village in the middle of nowhere, he spends his days farming, hunting, and talking with anyone who happens to pass through, eagerly devouring as many wondrous stories as he can. His most adventurous days involve practicing magic, much to the chagrin of anyone in the vicinity. Poor and unskilled, only in his wildest dreams did he imagine leaving his small village.

While hunting with his childhood friend, they stumble across a band of raiders preparing to attack their village. Desperate to return in time to warn the other villagers, Arkk takes a shortcut through the Cursed Forest where nothing grows and nothing lives. Arkk had no reason to believe otherwise until he stumbles across ruins from an age long past and the monster hailing from the olden days.

A bargain is made. A deal is struck. Arkk didn’t understand the ramifications of his agreement or the enemies it would create. Nevertheless, he has always been one to take advantage of every opportunity. The ruins he found represent the opportunity of a lifetime.

### Synopsis
Dyna Graves grew up thinking she was special. An exception to the average. Not necessarily above her peers, but simply outside their context. However, toward the end of her high school life, she started to realize that nobody was really special. At least not in any fantastical way.

Just as she started trying to figure out what she wanted to do with the rest of her life, she got an invitation. A psychic institute scoped her out, realized her psychic potential, and asked if she would undergo psionic training at the Carroll Institute.

Almost immediately, Dyna realized that she wasn’t quite up to the same level as many of her peers. Surrounded by clairvoyants and mind readers displaying obvious abilities made her own lack of ability all the more apparent.

That was, up until the researchers and scientists of the facility realized that there was a bit more to Dyna Graves than met the eye. After an explosive incident during what should have been a routine experiment, Dyna quickly found herself wrapped up in a world of cutthroat espionage.
