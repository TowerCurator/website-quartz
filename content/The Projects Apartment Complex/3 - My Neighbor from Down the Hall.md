Whenever someone knocked at my door, I did my best to ignore it. It was well-known that meeting other people in the Projects Apartment Complex had a strong tendency to lead toward bad ends. It wasn’t always possible to avoid others when errands needed to be ran but when I had nothing else going on? Best to let the knocker tire themselves out.

Of course, when living in a building with other people, it was inevitable that, as much as I might try to avoid them, I would eventually encounter others that I couldn’t simply ignore. Maybe someone jumped into the elevator just as the doors were closing. Or if I took the stairs, someone came up from down below.

At the moment, the incessant hammering against my apartment door, which had been going on for the past thirty minutes, was rapidly becoming something I couldn’t simply ignore.

“Who is it?” I called out.

The knocking paused, but nobody said anything. A moment later, the hammering picked up once more.

“Who is it?” I tried again.

They weren’t saying anything. This time, the knocking didn’t even stop.

With a long groan, I set down my book and shuffled over to the door, slipping into my slippers on the way. When I got there, I did *not* put my eye to the peep hole. That was dangerous. No, I simply unlatched the front door---keeping the chain in place---and pulled it open just a crack.

Black eyes, pointed horns, red skin, and a dark goatee framing a shark-toothed grin filled my vision.

“Kept me waiting.” His lips didn’t move as he spoke, but a little bit of steam escaped from his mouth as his teeth parted. Clamping his jaw back together, the grin widened beyond human limits. More sharp teeth slid into place to fill in the gaps, each locking into position with a soft click.

“Oh. Hello Mister Devil,” I said, undoing the chain and opening the door fully. I didn’t know the Devil’s name—we had never introduced ourselves to one another—but I did see him occasionally. We lived on the same floor, after all. His apartment was about fifty doors down. “You normally call before stopping by, so I didn’t know it was you.”

“I did try calling,” he said, tone perfectly polite, “but your phone isn’t plugged in.”

Turning my back to the Devil, I glanced around the entryway to where the phone normally hung on the wall. The pale paint on the wall was faded a bit while the phone itself sat on my counter-top. The phone line dangled, swaying as if affected by some unfelt breeze.

Or perhaps there was a breeze, one brought about by the Devil striding right into my apartment. He picked up my phone, plugged it in, and set it back on the nail in the wall. It immediately started to ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. It trembled back and forth with such violent thrashes that the wall started to crack.

“Oh dear. You’ve let a number of calls build up,” the Devil said.

All the while, the ringing continued, shaking, trembling. Even the floor started rocking back and forth as if an earthquake started up. I clamped my hands over my ears, but I could still hear it as if the phone’s bell was ringing inside my head.

Steam escaped from the Devil’s mouth. He said something, though I couldn’t hear what between my hands over my hears and that ringing noise. Picking up the receiver, he held it to his ear and spoke again. This time, it wasn’t just a small wisp of steam. A roiling wave of heat escaped his gaping jaw as it unhinged completely, turning his face from something *resembling* a human to a truly alien maw ready to devour existence itself. The steam from his mouth reversed directions, drawn back inside. Along with it, something from the phone receiver, steam colored black, flowed into his mouth as well.

The lights in my apartment flickered. In that one moment of total darkness, the ringing bell stopped. The rocking floor under my feet stilled. And, as the lights came back on, the Devil’s jaw clamped shut. Slowly, I peeled my sweaty palms from my ears.

“There,” he said. “Shouldn’t let things get that bad.”

“Sorry,” I said. “I wanted a bit of peace on my birthday a few...” I trailed off, scrunching my face up in thought. A few... *what*? Days? Hours? Weeks? How long had it been? How many days had passed? I... couldn’t quite remember.

My thoughts came to a stop as I thought of a slightly more pressing issue.

“Thanks, but I didn’t ask you to do that, I didn’t sign any documents, and I didn’t agree to any terms and conditions---”

The black pits that made up the Devil’s eyes lit up with tiny pricks of light. I blinked and his face filled my vision once again.

“Oh, don’t worry, don’t worry, my friend,” he said, steam escaping from his widening grin. “But... if there is something I desire if you wish to pay me back for this little trifle.”

Licking my lips, I tried to take a slow step back, only to feel the closed door of my apartment press up against my shoulders. “I, uh, prefer my soul where it is, I think.”

The Devil stared, then threw his head back and let out a loud guffaw. “A soul? For that? That’s not even worth your littlest finger. No, no. The wife is baking. Cookies! I *love* cookies, so imagine my dismay when I open the fridge to fetch her some eggs and find nothing there.”

“Eggs. Regular eating eggs that aren’t a metaphor for anything?”

“Just regular eggs,” he said, a small edge of exasperation entering his tone. “I told you before not to worry so much. We’re friends, you and I. Friends and neighbors. Stealing your soul on a slip of the tongue would be far, far from the neighborly thing to do.”

“Alright then. I can do eggs.” Slipping past him and entering my kitchen, I asked over my shoulder. “How many do you need?”

“Just two.”

Pulling the egg carton out of the fridge, I opened it up.

“Thanks,” the Devil said with his grin widening one last time. He vanished into a cloud of smoke, leaving me alone in my apartment once again.

I couldn’t be sure—reading the expression on such an entity wasn’t something any human could do—but I couldn’t help but feel like there had been some meaning in that last grin of his. A little joke that I couldn’t quite get.

He *knew* those were my last two eggs.

I would be having nothing but toast for breakfast.
