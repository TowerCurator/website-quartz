Laundry Day in the Projects Apartment Complex never ceased to be a harrowing experience. Anytime I left my apartment, there was always the possibility that I would meet someone—or something—else. That possibility increased tenfold when visiting public spaces like the restaurants, the pools, or the organ room. Everyone at the apartment knew that it was a bad idea to meet others, but sometimes it was just unavoidable.

Incidentally, I couldn’t recall who gave me that advice. The Landlord perhaps. I couldn’t be sure, but I credited my continued existence to that advice. On my floor, I had died the least of anyone. It said so in the records room.

As such, imagine my perturbation upon entering the laundry room and spotting a young woman seated in one of the waiting chairs. She wore vertically striped stockings and a vertically striped dress that ended at her knees. When I started past her to the machines, she looked up from the magazine she was reading and offered a polite smile.

“Hello,” she said, lifting a hand cloaked in a striped glove to wave.

If it was a bad idea to encounter others, it could be considered an *extra* bad idea to greet them. But at the same time, I didn’t like to be impolite. So, I offered a nod of my head and hurried over to one of the washing machines. The faster I got back to my room, the better off everyone would be.

But just as I reached for the washing machine’s handle, the woman cleared her throat. “Sorry,” she said, “that one is in use.”

I paused, hand on the handle, and peered inside. The machine didn’t seem to be moving, but upon closer inspection through the window, there was a single striped stocking inside.

A dozen questions ran through my mind. If the machine was stopped, why didn’t she move it to the dryer? Did she only own striped clothing? Didn’t she have more laundry to do? Why was there only one sock? Where was its pair?

Naturally, I didn’t voice any of my questions. They really didn’t matter. The laundry room had been built to satisfy the needs of the Projects’ tenants. With the Projects being unfathomably large with an uncountable number of residents, there were a lot of washing and drying machines.

I simply moved on to the next machine.

“Sorry,” the woman said. “That one is in use too.”

Blinking, I peered inside. The fluorescent tubes flickered over this machine, making it difficult to see in, but I could see enough to answer one of my questions.

I found the previous stocking’s pair.

Now I had even more questions. Why was there only one stocking in this washing machine? Why weren’t they together? Why only one article of clothing again?

Shaking my head, I moved on.

“Sorry,” the woman said.

One striped glove sat at the bottom of the next washing machine. And its pair in the one after. At each washing machine, the woman apologized. I passed a striped shoe. A striped dress. Another striped shoe. A striped scrunchy of some sort---bracelet, anklet, or hair scrunchy, perhaps. The items in the washing machines started to get stranger and stranger, but they all had black and white stripes. A cellphone case. A hat. Bedsheets, I could understand. A plate? Our apartments had dishwashers. At least mine did.

I kept going, on and on. I couldn’t help but check in each and every washing machine just to find out what was coming next. A couch cushion and a bandanna. A fake nail and...

I stopped abruptly, peering closer to the window of the next washing machine. There was a single piece of clothing inside. It wasn’t just lying damp like the rest, but looked as if some invisible entity was wearing it within the machine. As soon as I realized what was inside, my ears started burning as I imagined that woman wearing them.

“You... didn’t see them, did you?”

Hot breath tickled the hairs on my neck. A sudden feeling of foreboding gripped my heart as an impending sense of doom welled up. The voice was much closer, much deeper, and far, far less polite.

“You... saw them?”

The obvious answer was simple. Lie. Lie like my life depended on it. But I couldn’t turn away from those shapely curves. With the way they were suspended in the air, I could almost imagine them on her. My nose was practically pressed against the glass. Striped with lacy bits. Fancy. The kind someone put on for *someone* other than themselves. As a hot-blooded human, I couldn’t pretend I hadn’t seen them.

“They’re very nice,” I said, deciding on the next obvious answer. Compliment them.

“Oh,” the woman said. “You’re an honest one.”

The pressure against my back receded instantly.

Glancing back the way I had come, even though I had run past dozens of washing machines, the woman still sat in the same chair, reading her magazine. It was like she had never moved.

The next washing machine did not have striped clothing in it. I didn’t mean to look this time, but I didn’t really need to in order to see what was inside.

Thick red liquid bubbled up against the side of the washing machine’s glass window. Strands of brown hair and bits of broken teeth and bone clung to the insides of the machine. Red dripped down despite the water seal of the door.

I passed thirty-seven similar washing machines before finding a vacant machine. I dumped my laundry basket inside, poured a little detergent into the machine and twisted the knob. Lacking anything else to do and not wishing to engage in the arduous trek back to my room, I walked over to the waiting chairs and took a seat one away from the woman.

She smiled at me as I sat down.

I gave her a polite nod back and took out a book I intended to read while waiting.

Two more people came in while my laundry was in the machine. I didn’t look up. I didn’t acknowledge them in any way. They didn’t pay any attention to me. They never sat down at the waiting chairs. That was the way it was supposed to be.

When I heard my laundry go off, the two washing machines after mine were dripping red.

*Today is a nice day out*, I decided, gathering up my wet laundry. Rather than use the dryers, I headed back up to my apartment to hang my clothes from the balcony.

All in all, a fairly uneventful laundry day.
