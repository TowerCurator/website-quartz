Not every tenant of the Projects Apartment Complex was human.

That was a simple fact that every resident knew. It was generally not a good idea to encounter non-human residents. Or anyone at all. So, when I arrived at my floor, walked down the hall to my apartment, opened the door with my key, and saw a body lying in its own blood, I calmly closed the door and locked it.

Nope.

Not today. Sorry.

Down the hallway, somehow both looming and narrow while stretching endlessly far, I finally made it to the pay phones near the elevator. I picked up the receiver, put my finger in the zero, and spun the rotary all the way around. It took three rings, but the other line picked up.

“Hi, Mister Landlord. It’s room six-one-six.”

There was no response on the other end of the line. At least not in words a human could understand. If I had to put it to words, it would be... the sound of a children’s nursery rhyme tune, *so* familiar yet just off the tip of my tongue, broadcast through the world’s worst radio receiver to make sure it was nice and crackly with odd distortions.

“Yes, me again.” I couldn’t explain it, but the meaning still came through despite the lack of words. “Sorry to bother you this late at night but there is a body in my room. Yes, it looked dead... No, I didn’t check... Thank you.”

The constant musical drone from the phone died down and I hung up.

He said he would handle it. Or he *intoned* that he would handle it? *He*? Whatever. I had nothing left to do but head back to my room. Before sticking my key into the lock, I double-checked the number on the wall. I probably should have checked that earlier. This wouldn’t have been the first time I accidentally got off on the wrong floor and opened up the wrong room. They all looked the same.

I tried not to think about what that might mean if other tenants could open my door.

Unfortunately, it was my room.

Key in the lock, I undid the bolt and pushed open the door.

The entryway was completely clean of any bodies or blood, yet not cleaner than I had left it. A bit of dirt, tracked in on my shoes, and dust in the corners looked about right. Kicking off my shoes and slipping into slippers, I stepped inside, locked and chained the door behind me, and let out a long sigh.

The Projects was definitely an interesting place. I... couldn’t remember ever living anywhere else and yet, I knew, somehow, that it wasn’t a normal apartment complex. I could say with a 67% confidence that people outside the Projects didn’t come home from work to find dead bodies on their floor. Or, if they did have bodies on the floor, they probably didn’t disappear after a quick call to their landlord. In fact, the entire concept of landlords seemed strange. They probably didn’t have landlords either.

And, slipping into my slippers and stepping into my living area, I doubted they had to worry about those glowing red lights outside their balcony door that probably weren’t eyes but I certainly wasn’t going to get closer to actually check.

Nope. Not today.

Rather than bother my landlord a second time in the same night, I ensured the sixth-floor balcony door had its chain firmly in place then simply pulled the curtains closed.

Problem solved.

Finally able to get on with my night, I tossed a pizza into the oven and crashed on the couch. After a rough day at work, it was nice to just relax and forget about everything. Especially on today of all days. I didn’t want to deal with apartment nonsense. I didn’t want to deal with thinking about things. In fact...

Swinging my legs over the side of the couch, I hurried over to the phone hanging from the wall. Before I could grab the cord and yank it out, the phone rang. I considered pulling the plug anyway, but not wanting anything to get stuck inside the receiver, I picked it up.

“Hello?”

“*Happy birthday to you\~ Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear ᕕ¿˘ØӘɲ≥˘´... Happy birthday to! You!*”

I let out a small sigh. Despite everything, I couldn’t help the small smile on my face. “Thanks. That was nice of you. Who is this, by the way?”

“*Now now, don’t you remember your dear ›æıµ˘´’s voice?*”

“Mom?” That was *not* my mother’s voice. Even when she was alive, she didn’t talk like that. This was too... deep and masculine. “You sound a bit different,” I said, deciding to humor the voice. “Are you sick?”

“*Aww, thanks for worrying about me. You remind me so much of œæ†Ә´≥ \`µ°¿¿°”. I wish he could be here today*.”

“Uh... yeah. Poor... dad? I miss him.”

“*Dad? You silly. He’s your brother*.”

“Oh,” I said, grimacing. “I don’t have a brother.”

“*Bęcąu҉se̕ ͏you ͏m͠u͢rd̶ered̵ ̧h̴im̨.*”

I hung up. It was a wrong number anyway. Before anyone could call back, I took the phone off the wall and yanked the cable from the back. My first instinct was right after all. Better to spend my birthday in peace and quiet.

Hearing the oven beep, I hurried over, grabbed the oven mitts, and pulled out a large, 3-layer birthday cake. The candles were already lit and slowly burning down. After setting it down on the counter, I turned back to the oven and peered inside.

My pizza was gone.

With a long, exasperated sigh, I closed the oven and shot a glare at the cake. Handwritten lettering made from frosting adorned the side.

*Happy Birthday from the Projects*

“Oh well. Happy birthday to me,” I said, blowing out the candles.
